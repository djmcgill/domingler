# Domingler

Takes mods for dominions 5, and scans them for the IDs that they use. In the future it will actually 
mingle them together and remap IDs as needed. 

### TODO:
- ID types still not scanned:
    - events
    - poptypes
- scan names:
    - all existing IDs
    - also mercs
- modpack creation
- proper way to give inputs etc
- check limits
- far summon spells
- there's a bunch of FIXMEs
