In addition, being essentially linked to the Faery realm, they cost half of their normal price while Fata Morgana is active and this global will also cause every fully controlled temple with maximal Luck scales and friendly dominion to automatically let another Tuatha Warrior enter the mortal world for free every month."

The Aboleths firmly believe that the entire world is theirs by right and treat younger and less intelligent species as mere cattle, especially humans, who never posed a threat to them and can't even breathe underwater without being touched by their secretions. Considered no good for anything but hard work, captured humans are most of the time immediately lobotomized, this operation entirely removing their free will and most of their cognitive abilities. Although they require the presence of a mage overseer to direct their actions, the resulting workers are obedient and might even accept death without a word if life essentials aren't provided to them. While weaker than lobo guards in combat, they are more efficient at using tools for crafting and extracting purposes, and they can be mass produced easily even far from the coast. However, the human body tolerates that treatment much worse than the Atlantian's, and therefore lobotomized humans have an extremely short life expectancy."

#descr "Serpent Dancers are cultic dancers of the Great Temple of C'tis. They intoxicate themselves with serpent venom and perform whirling ritual dances. During these dances, they may strike someone in the audience with their poisonous staffs. Should the target survive the poisoning, it is considered a most fortunate event and his hatchlings would be accepted as acolytes in the Temple. Sometimes the Serpent Dancers are called upon to join the armies of C'tis as sacred, fanatic warriors. They wield magical snake staffs, but they never don armor as it would hamper their ritual adulations. The snake staffs are magical and capable of hurting ethereal beings. Serpent Dancers are highly resistant to most forms of poison, and when blessed they enter a berserker trance under the effect of the psychoactive toxins they consume."

#descr "Knowing that unlike the Phlegran Tyrants they lack semidivine blood and other extraordinary powers, the Oppressors have long been worried about the perennity of their rule. Thus, they have never ceased thinking of new ways to ensure their survival both against the people and against exterior threats such as other more magically powerful nations or the terrifying perspective of the Laestrygonians' return. Weaving contacts with powerful mercenary lords and putting the mighty Cyclops military on their side have been two of their oldest ideas, already serving them in the old war against Phlegra; but the Oppressors haven't stopped there, and, enslaving the Elder Cyclopes and shackling them in their dark dungeons, they have relentlessly spent their efforts and resources in supporting technological progress in service of their armies - the only way they could ever compete with the Gigantes and other formidable creatures that still roam this world. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Porphyrian mastery of metallurgy, architecture and engineering is so advanced compared to other nations of this age. Crossbows also are one of the greatest marvels of Porphyrian manufacturing, a secret weapon that the Oppressors mass produced and won't hesitate to use as soon as they can - after all, the Cyclopes are there to keep the human slaves in check, so there are no qualms about giving human soldiers good arms."

Since humans cannot compete with the strength of the cyclopes there are no qualms about giving them good arms.

Thus the Iron Bound almost never rout, even though their morale and loyalty is the same as that of most slave soldiers. The coerced bravery makes the Iron Bound fight more aggressively and they care less about defending themselves. They can only be commanded by mages able to control the collars.

#name "Mouflon Cataphract"
#descr "Since old times the wild Cyclopes of Porphyrion and Phlegra have herded great mouflon sheep. In preparation for the great war against Phlegra a few generations ago and under the advice of the Oppressors, the Cyclopes have bred and trained the great sheep to carry human riders in an attempt to mimic the mounted tactics of other nations and surprise the Phlegran Tyrants with the strength of their military. This tactic has greatly helped Porphyrion in obtaining victory and independence from the Gigantes, and as such it has persisted to this day, now being complemented by the very advanced armaments produced by the Porphyrian exceptional arts of metallurgy. The mouflon are not as fast as horses, but they are stronger and they can provide supplies for the army. Mouflon Cataphracts are slave soldiers and serve out of fear rather than loyalty. They have abysmal morale compared to the knights and cataphracts of other nations, but can be pushed to bravery by cruel taskmasters."

#name "Iron Guard"
#descr "The Iron Guards are elite slave soldiers trained from a young age in Telepylos. Chosen for their physical strength and robustness they are superior to all but the Cyclops soldiers. The Iron Guards never retreat from battle. They might get killed to the last man, but they never rout. Or at least that is how they are perceived by Porphyrion's neighbors. The truth is a bit more sinister. Since the independence of Porphyrion and even before then, humans have given their services to their Tyrant and Oppressor masters to gain power over their fellow men. The first Oppressors managed to enslave magically skilled humans with the aid of enchanted collars designed with the aid of the Elder Cyclopes. With the necessity for unbreakable strength against the threats of revolution, other more magically powerful nations and the terrifying perspective of the Laestrygonians' eventual return, the mages of Porphyrion have honed their skills and now not only mages are bound by magical shackles. The Iron Guards are given enchanted slave bands to ensure that they never break in battle. These slave bands do not enhance morale per se, but should the slaves abandon orders or rout from battle the band will cause excruciating pain and possibly kill the wearer. The Iron Guards are braver than most slave warriors, and the knowledge that they might die should they flee makes them almost unbreakable in combat. The Iron Guards can only be commanded by mages able to control the collars. If all friendly mages are routed or killed they might end up dying. The Iron Guards are privileged as slaves go and serve as personal guards of the Oppressors and elite shock troops used only in the most important battles."

Considering the fact that legs and arms are equally common among protozoons, the existence of triskelioi is inevitable, since sciapods - the most numerous of sentient blemmyes - have two arms for one leg. As such, triskelioi are widely believed to be formed of the many legs in surplus. Still, their generation doesn't follow any preordained plan, and just like protozoons, with whom they share most of their qualities, they are completely devoid of intelligence. Since their entire body is made of nothing but legs, triskelioi are known in the lands of U as one of the fastest terrestrial creatures in existence. In order to avoid losing balance, triskelioi never walk. Instead, unable to ever stop their course, they continuously roll forward not unlike a wheel, and when numerous enough they mindlessly trample everything in their path, repeatedly kicking with great agility, speed and strength anything too large to be climbed over."

#descr "Probably the most primitive of sentient blemmyes, Epiphagoi are degenerate sciapods who are known and feared for their cannibalistic practices and cruelty towards weaker beings and humans. Living a troglodyte lifestyle apart from the rest of their race, they are barely more intelligent than most animals and clearly more violent and noxious. Everywhere they go they bring havoc and more than one welcoming land became a waste due to their destructive and unclean behavior. The only thing they respect is strength, which is part of the reason why only the toughest and sturdiest of sciapods are fit to lead the people of U. In battle, Epiphagoi are exactly as fearsome as they sound: they always attempt to attack their targets in greater numbers and they strike them with extreme brutality, using both their muscular arms and their powerful jaws as weapons, and entering a devastating berserker rage as soon as they are hurt. Although they are extremely voracious and as such vulnerable to starvation, they never seem to stop reproducing, consuming and depleting their environment, regardless of the suffering this will cause them. As such, they always find a way to survive even in the most inhospitable lands, especially since they can still eat each other or weaker, unfortunate blemmyes when in shortage of supplies. Therefore, any province where there are at least five Epiphagoi will suffer the loss of twenty inhabitants per month, in exchange causing an additional Epiphagos to spawn unless the province is entirely devoid of life. Sometimes, an Anthropophagos will even appear to guide them in barbarity, and for as long as at least one is doing so, an additional Epiphagos will join his tribe a month out of two on average."

Although their society is less organized than those of other sciapods - Epiphagoi excepted -, they are clever enough to see that the God of U welcomes them more than any other and to willingly serve him. They also are renowned among blemmyes for their unique interest in technology; indeed, they have developed primitive crafting techniques and frequently make use of stone spears and nets in war. Yet, they certainly are not any more intelligent than regular sciapods, as for most other matters they appear to be both short-sighted and short-tempered, and their understanding of long term planning and strategy is often extremely superficial, making them easy to trick. Still, while unskilled, their very disorganized military makes an efficient use of their innate strengths: hard to catch due to their size, quickness and agility, Lilliputian warriors always travel in group and try to outnumber their enemies as well as to harass them until they can no longer defend themselves. In addition to being recruitable in all forts, Lilliputians can be gathered in great numbers by their Sophotatos leaders."

#name "Sciapod Tribesman"
#descr "The most common and the least uncivilized of sciapods, tribesmen are also the closest to humans. They form the caste of the weak, and although their society is primitive, it is still built on mutual aid and cooperation, at least for as long as the strong who rule them let them be. Rather unfit physically when compared to other sciapods, they prefer to live in a peaceful environment, which makes them more docile than most other members of their species and incites them to count on their intelligence rather than on their strength. In spite of these qualities, they remain generally very unskilled, poor, uneducated and not very bright, unless they are brave enough to leave blemmye society and explore the world as either outcasts or military scouts, or embrace the true strength or their kin by joining the priestly caste in the temples. Still, not everyone is born to become a priest and most tribesmen have to accept that they'll better care for their loved ones and themselves by fulfilling other, less prestigious functions, such as those of hunter, breeder or stone carver. But even that is not a chance one can take for granted in the unforgiving lands of U: for several reasons - a weak intellectual capacity, the fear of jealousy from the strong, the cult of the body and its innate abilities, distrust of mankind and anything that comes from it... -, blemmyes almost entirely eschew technology, which causes craftsmanship to be of very minor use in U, and agriculture is similarly underdeveloped due to the barren state of the lands of blemmyes. As a consequence, unable to make themselves useful to their leaders, many tribesmen are forced to live as scavengers in idleness and suffering, which can even lead some to lose their last semblance of humanity by becoming cannibalistic Epiphagoi. Although a few try to avoid that fate by becoming soldiers and, one day hopefully, athletes among the strong, most only fight when ordered so by their chieftains, naked and unarmed."

#name "Sciapod Athlete"
#descr "While sciapods eschew technology and often live as troglodytes, the least uncivilized of their tribes still have a proper culture - a language, a society, a religion, rites, arts and traditions. In that regard, one of the most obvious and important manifestations of sciapods' aesthetics and philosophy might be their cult of the body, its strength and its beauty. In U, gymnastics, bodybuilding and sports in general have a sacred status and are considered to express the inherent nobility of sciapods the most perfectly. The ever-growing refinement and surpassing of the self, the constant mental and physical struggle for performance both alone and in fraternal competition, the intimate knowledge of one's own limitations and how to overcome them, and finally the refusal to do so while cheating with external help: those are some of the most important values of sciapods as taught by the Priests of U. It is no wonder, then, if they refuse to use artificial tools - as they dishonor the innate ability of the body - or even clothes - which would hide the body instead of making it shine with health, might and pride. The most virtuous followers of this doctrine, sciapod athletes are deeply admired and loved by regular tribesmen, who greatly enjoy watching them fight for glory in the Teratomachic games and dream of one day reaching their heights - for they are living examples of the fact that it is indeed possible, for one of the weak, to eventually become one of the strong and reach a higher social status through sheer effort and merit. Although they consider their efficiency as warriors to be a very secondary effect of their training, sciapod athletes are among the greatest martial artists of U. These oiled wrestlers' capabilities are directly proportionate to the amount of time and energy they spend working out daily, so they are much stronger in lands of Production while being weaker in lands of Sloth - a true athlete never has any time to spare in vain pursuits."

These brutal and stupid half-giants reign over lesser blemmyes by sheer strength and are happy to serve their chieftain for as long as he remains the strongest. They do not tolerate disrespect from weaker than them and refuse to obey commanders of a smaller size. Just like athletes, with which they share their unconditional love of strength training, they somewhat lose shape when they give in to Sloth and become mightier instead when in lands of effort, work and Production. Still, even when at their lowest, they remain formidable warriors, living mountains of brawn and muscle that fight with great discipline and without a second thought for their victims."

#name "War Boulder"
#descr "One of the mightiest mundane weapons known to blemmyes, War Boulders are huge, round rocks that are pushed around on the battlefield by the strongest of sciapods, protecting their operators like giant shields and crushing their foes like insects. Although blemmyes rarely use any equipment at all, polishing a great stone and making it roll is a simple enough concept for their limited intellect to grasp and for their primitive tools to execute, and their immense muscular power also allows them to be much more efficient than humans when using such a crude armament in warfare. Although creating and displacing War Boulders takes a great amount of work and resources, which makes them slow both to construct and to move around, their very low cost as well as their great impact both in battle and in siegecraft explain their continuous importance in blemmye strategy. This may seem surprising to foreigners, as pushing a huge weight uphill at first sounds impossible with only one leg: at least two appear to be required to stop the boulder from rolling down all the while advancing alongside it. But onlookers know that this is not a real issue to blemmyes, thanks to their lack of head. Indeed, everytime the boulder's operator reaches the maximal extension of his arms, he blocks the giant stone with his headless shoulders, maintains his posture by grasping the ground with his hands, and uses that time period to displace his unique foot closer to the rock before starting that cycle anew, thus ensuring a steady march regardless of the slope he has to escalate. With enough strength, endurance and training, the greatest of sciapod athletes are thus able to handle that formidable weapon with uncanny ease. When a War Boulder is finally destroyed or otherwise rendered useless, its operator abandons it and continues fighting on his own as a regular Sciapod Champion."

#name "Gavagai"
#descr "Gavagai giants are a species of blemmyes of titanic size with anatomical traits similar to that of sciapods. While usually less intelligent than them to the point of having noticeable troubles using language, they also are much stronger and sturdier, which, along with their towering height, makes them terrifying opponents and largely explains why they generally don't need to use their brains to survive. Rumored to be able to displace mountains single-handedly, they evidently surpass even the most muscular sciapods in physical might and are truly capable of incredible feats of strength, such as throwing huge boulders in battle or using them to destroy fortifications. Still, it may be that their inner differences with sciapods are the greatest; in most cases indeed, the mind of these solitary creatures is as soft as it is slow, and their kind heart is vulnerable to pain and manipulation alike. Thus, a few less naive and more ambitious Gavagais exploit these weaknesses to force their brothers into submission and wage permanent war against each other, at such a large scale that it only rarely affects other blemmyes. In any case, either under the command of these brutal tyrants - generally called their chieftains - or out of genuine love for their tiny cousins, Gavagais are among the greatest defenders of U, and without them it may be that blemmyes would have been enslaved or eradicated long ago, making of them the seemingly eternal keepers of the entire blemmye race."

#name "Dancer of the Foot"
#descr "Like all blemmyes, due to the natural mechanism of their birth from random protozoons, sciapods are extremely diverse anatomically. This is mostly true of their size, but sometimes also of their proportions, so it is not exceedingly rare for them to be born with one or more hypertrophied limbs. In particular, those that are gifted with an unusually large foot are considered blessed by the God and often become traditional dancers in the temples, attaining sacred, untouchable status. Their strange discipline is one of the greatest manifestations of blemmye art and, while very hard to perform without training, is considered the most beautiful and meaningful way to express oneself in U. As such, even regular sciapods are often taught the very basics of that dance since childhood so that they are able to take part in the happiest celebration there is to blemmyes, a monthly social gathering during which the whole tribe assembles in joy and harmony regardless of social status to pray, dance and sing for the Awakening God. While regular tribesmen can dance however they want in this circumstance, they still try to emulate the sacred dancers' very codified technique, which, except for a few moves entailing some use of the back or the shoulders, involves standing on one's hands alone, all the while rhythmically waving one's unique foot in the air in diversified patterns and doing various acrobatic jumps or quick rotations of the body. To achieve such skill, they seldom stand on their foot even outside religious context, instead walking on their hands almost permanently, a feat which would be impossible without their natural lack of head and immense agility. Misunderstanding that weird behavior, foreign onlookers have speculated that sciapods use their foot to shield themselves from the sun, which explains why their name means shadow-foot; but they nonetheless know that U's acrobats are extraordinary warriors capable of beheading a man with a single hit of their powerful foot."

The Garnet Amazons are said to have sprung from an early breeding experiment of the Warlocks of Smouldercone. They are resistant to fire and use Blood and Fire magic as the Abysians do. They are more aggressive and arrogant than the other tribes. Thanks to their supernatural origins, they are strong of body and easy to train as soldiers. Thus, the armies of Zun are vast and disciplined."

#descr "At the center of the temple-city of Zun, there is an utterly thin mountainous pike that points towards the sky like a needle piercing the clouds. This very peculiar geological formation, sacred to the Amazons of Zun, is called the Spire of Justice and towers over a vast region like the throne of a god. Its very narrow summit, covered in pure snow and only accessible by secret stairways or by flight, is an altar of utmost importance to the holy order of Vestals, mage-priestesses of Fire, Vengeance and Femininity who use it for their scrying and their sacrifices. On these natural templegrounds, maidens are trained to become Vestals and represent Amazon-kind before the whole world. Vestal Novices are too young and inexperienced to be allowed to use magic on their own, but they are remarkable sacred warriors nonetheless. These elite archers are able to conjure sacred fire to light their arrows aflame and burn their foes."

Most members of the Wind Tribe also love to keep beautiful feathers as decorative talismans which they wear proudly on their clothes or in their hair, both as a spiritual habit and an aesthetic one; this is also done for arrows, and each one is adorned with a uniquely colored fletching."

Horses are an integral part of the Wind Tribe's everyday life in the vast plains that surround Thalamanth. There are a few Wind Tribe people that live a sedentary life, building small relays for travelers and their horses, where both can rest in beds or stables. But most are nomads, and moving from one relay to another, they explore the lands and live together with their animals. In the Wind Tribe, horses are thought to have a soul like humans and are almost considered their equals. Therefore, it is no surprise that the Wind Tribe also uses horses in warfare."

#descr "Aurae are lesser divinities of the wind that manifest themselves as incredibly beautiful women. Few mortals would dream of harming an Aurae. Aurae very rarely show themselves at other times than in the sweetest of twilights, except to wreak vengeance upon those who desecrate the sky, the poetry of the breeze or the peaks that are their sanctuaries. In the mountains of Thalamanth, the two best known of these primeval natural sanctuaries, one facing the Dusk and the other facing the Dawn, predate even the first human settlers; but another one can be found hidden on the summit of Mount Ida, in Arcadeia. The Aurae that live here are worshipped by Amazons and Arcadeians alike as the incorruptible, living embodiments and benevolent protectors of purity, gentleness and spontaneity unrestrained. When they descend from their remote homes to punish the unfaithful, they wear gleaming bronze armor and their mere presence is enough to heighten the hearts of Arcadeians, Amazons and Wind Tribe warriors alike. Since their physical bodies are as translucent and evanescent as their veilings of wind-borne glamour, they are often mistaken for ghosts and are very difficult to harm. Wind stills itself at their silent command and they are ever-graceful even in the harshest of storms. As the natural enemies of unfair violence and unclean magic, they will always answer the call of the Kindly Ones when it is sounded and their recruitment cost will be vastly reduced in such circumstances. So light that they only require morning dew and whispering poetry for their sustenance, they are free from most earthly needs and neither cost upkeep nor need to eat."

Amazon Initiates mostly come from the Wind Tribe, which they abandon joyfully to start a new life, and often dream of becoming the Amazon ideal of an inflexible sacred warrior, thus emulating both the fighting and living styles of the Amazon Exemplars. To test their courage and purity, they are not allowed to wear armor or use a bow. Those who distinguish themselves in battle may become sacred Exemplars and lead their sisters to victory. Temples are usually needed to educate them but Pythias also teach them wherever they go."

#descr "Before the last great war, Triliaxians and arcoscephalians alike saw archery as a cowardly and foolish pursuit. But then the forces of Arcosephale and its allies laid siege to the Divine Citadel for ten long and perilous years, and even the elite Myrmidons were powerless before the vast ranks of their foes. It was Pareas-Aleksandros, prince of Triliax and then commander of the armies, who first went to the walls armed with a bow, and his success against the enemy champions was such that the invaders' forces soon faced a withering wall of arrows with each advance, each successful volley inspiring more of the defenders to take up the bow. Pareas-Aleksandros has since been cast down and discredited for his role in bringing the ultimately disastrous war to Triliax, and archers are still mocked and despised in Arcosephale, but none in Triliax will ever disparage them again. Triliaxian archers wear leather armor and crested helmets dyed with the colors of the sea."

Like all Myrmidons, they wield short swords and carry shields, but unlike others they also bear magical tattoos that remind them of the sacred horses of Trilios, children of foam, a great symbol of nobility that strengthens them when a High Priest of the Sea accompanies them."

In its old wars against the wild forces of Pangaea before the founding of its sacred walls and civilization, Triliax had the opportunity to enslave some fierce centaur warriors. Since then, the centaur slaves of Triliax have lost some of their skill due to captivity, but they still are valuable both in warfare and for hard labor. Like most slaves, they have poor morale because they lack training, fight unwillingly and are eager to free themselves; and for the same reasons, the enslaved centaurs have also lost their ability to go berserk in battle or to hide in enemy territory, as well as their knowledge of the forest, which they no longer can call home. However, even though they are weaker than their wild counterparts, they are relatively cheap to field, and they still are valuable for their natural quickness, strength and endurance."

#descr "Cyclopes are one-eyed and stone-skinned giants sprung from the roots of antediluvian mountains, and those from Triliax are even more monstrous and frightening than others of their kin. Some have always lived along the steep and rocky coasts of Triliax, even before the fall of Therodos. They also are the reason why this region remained uncivilized until the arrival of Trilios: their great violence is frightening to men, and many sailors and adventurers found death by unexpectedly encountering a Cyclops' den. The hills of Dardanum are a sacred place to Cyclopes, because rather than being of natural origins, they are in fact an old tumulus that serves as a cemetery for their kind. Conversely, Cyclopes are themselves sacred to the people of Triliax: as the most perfect of all monsters, they represent all monsterkind and therefore one of the three aspects of the Wrath of the God. Without the monster cult of Triliax, never could men have built a kingdom in the region of Dardanum; but since Cyclopes and Triliaxians serve the same God, they cooperate and form a single force. Although they often fight in small numbers with human armies, in times of great need they also form the Monstrous Phalanx and devastate everything in their path. Due to their size, they are very gluttonous creatures. In battle, they use sheer force against their enemies and crush them with primitive clubs of giant size, and they are able to destroy or repair stone fortifications with ease. A Cyclops commander is required to train them."

This holds true for many different traits: external appearance, physical prowess, personality, intelligence... Thus, one never knows what kind of bird will show up when recruiting a Warrior of the Clouds, and might even get lucky enough to find a Bird of Gold instead. While they are not as clever as a man, and while some are indeed utterly stupid, many Warriors of the Clouds are smart enough to understand basic abstract concepts. As a whole, the birds are far smarter than most humans will admit, and their many songs preserve a rich cultural tradition. Although they usually act more with spontaneity than with reflexion, most Warriors of the Clouds understand that they fight for their kin's supremacy as a whole, or at least for the survival and prosperity of their tribe. A great pride of being a part of the Nation of the Birds links them together and incites to go to war. Still, they are but animals and will flee at the slightest reversal of fortune in battle. They are mostly unable to understand complex strategies, and only a great mass of such birds can overcome a squad of well-trained and equipped men. The better side of things is that they are extremely cheap and wild enough not to cost any upkeep."

#descr "Ashen Trees are the empty shells of long-dead Sky Trees. Having lost their benevolence at the same time as their life and consciousness, they are of no interest to most birds and aren't respected as anything more than simple carcasses. Still, they make good shelters and can be used defensively in case of war, even more so due to the vines and thorns that grow around them. They are also used as occult symbols and meeting places by Wyrd Birds and their masters, which means that an Ashen Tree must be present in the province in order to recruit them."

#name "Wyrd Bird"
#descr "Wyrd Birds are ravenous, misshapen scavengers and bringers of misfortune that live apart from other birds. They dwell hidden in dark and sickly places and are often deformed, diseased or lame. The hoi polloi sometimes calls them weird or wyrd, and superstitious or perhaps wise people tell that they form covens to study the mysteries of the occult and conspire against mankind. Although even other birds dislike them, the Republic of the Clouds sometimes uses their services in exchange for the right to approach the utopic Nephelococcygia. They can only be found in provinces with an Ashen Tree, and they'll desert it if a fort is built there. They are much more stealthy and cunning than most other birds."

#descr "Migratory Warriors are regular bird predators that spend most their life traveling from a corner of the world to another. In battle, they are very similar to Warriors of Prey, but they are too free-spirited to stay in the same place for long. Therefore, they will only fight until they cause or suffer a wound before leaving on their next trip. Their independence still has some good sides, since it makes them less costly both in gold and supplies, and, like Warriors of the Clouds, allows them not to cost any upkeep. In addition, as great travelers that can fly very high in the sky for very long periods of time without getting tired, they can move further than Warriors of Prey and even cross the oceans. They can be recruited anywhere, but the presence of a bird commander of great stature or of a sentient tree is required to assemble them."

For sure, they are smaller and weaker than Terror Falcons or Great Eagles, but none is more blood-thirsty than they are. Their kin was birthed the very day the blood of a man was spilled for the first time upon the holy ground of the City in the Sky. After having dismembered him alive, they drank his blood, bathed in it and shredded the rest of him to pieces. Then, they sealed the Oath of Nephelococcygia against Mankind and the Gods, swearing that none would prevent the rise of the birds to godhood, and their order entered existence at the same time as their cruelty. Since then, whole flocks of them can be seen gracefully gliding across the sky or resting in peaceful places. Woe to the unfortunate soul that would then cross their path and choose to contemplate their gentle wings or the soft pink of their feathers, for they would take great pleasure in mutilating and maiming her. In battle, none could say whether they look more like angels or demons, for clearly they have both the former's purity and the latter's fury. Although Nephelococcygia is the only place where their raising is institutionalized, any blood priest is able to anoint more by ritual sacrifice."

It is almost immune to the elements and its great beauty discourages mortal minds from harming it. It is ever graceful and entirely unaffected by storms. It attacks its foes with blinding flashes of colored light that can burn away their eyes forever. Its ability to bring good fortune and health makes it a very precious weapon of the Nation of the Birds, and it is considered sacred like all other golden birds. It can both be recruited in Nephelococcygia and summoned. Only wizards and Solar Birds have the magical ability necessary to lead the Spirits of the Four Seasons in combat."

#descr "Terror Falcons are falcons of immense size that are strong enough to carry a horse and fierce enough to battle a dragon. They are quite intelligent and can understand human speech. Although they are generally weaker than their cousins the Great Eagles, they are also nimbler and more common, especially in non-mountainous regions. They have extraordinarily good eyes as well, and they have no fear of flying for long periods of times, which makes them able to cross the oceans. They expend great amounts of energy in their everyday tasks and must eat huge amounts of food to remain healthy. Their cry is terrifying to animals and men alike and makes them feared by the people of most cultures. Admired by all birds as the royal wings of victory, Terror Falcons are the greatest defenders of Nephelococcygia and are well known for building architecturally complex nests of the size of a great house or a small manor. When they gather in large enough numbers and are helped by flocks of smaller birds, these nests can reach the dimensions of a city and be used as small fortresses in times of war."

#descr "Although the savants, leaders and librarians of Isphenople are usually human, they are only a minority in the ancient city. Most of its population is actually still of C'tissian origins, as it descends from the people of Isphi. While the C'tissians of Isphenople prefer to live peaceful lives as farmers, fishers, crafters and traders, they still have to defend their homes in case of war. They are skilled at surviving swamps and the desert, and like all C'tissians, they have a thick hide, innately resist poisons and are able to swim accross rivers. They however aren't very skilled in combat, and they actually are notorious for their cowardice. Since they expect their human leaders to protect them against invaders, they rarely volunteer in the military and ask for high wages in spite of their general inefficiency. As a testimony to their hybrid culture, they wear Ermorian bronze scale cuirasses but use falchions and round shields of C'tissian design instead of the tower shields standard to the Isphenoplian order of the Guardians of Knowledge."

#descr "A juggernaut is a colossal structure made out of religious idols and two pairs of enormous wheels. The machine is powered by Astral magic and requires magical leadership. A construction like this has to be almost as holy as the God himself and will rightfully spread the Dominion of its God just like a Prophet. The juggernaut is covered by a layer of gold to make it look even more religiously important. Building it through means other than rituals requires the presence of an engineer in the province, and it will not require any upkeep in spite of its gold cost."

#descr "Guardians of Knowledge are elite warriors that are ready to protect the Ancient Library and its inestimable treasures with their lives. While their corps was created by the Ermorian Emperor when Isphenople was still Imperial property, a few didn't leave the Scholar Citadel when it became independent, and thus became full citizens of Isphenople. Today, while they are far less numerous than they were during the Imperial period, they are also better armed, as the Library can afford to make its few warriors as formidable as possible and indeed must do so to ensure its security. Thus, each Guardian of Knowledge is equipped with both an enchanted broad sword that either deals additional elemental damage to its target or unravels the substance of magical beings; and with a fire-resistant shield and set of heavy armor. These are very useful to complete his firefighting duties, which are of critical importance to the Conclave, for fire is a worse enemy of the Library than any external foe could ever be - a simple spark could be enough to destroy all the precious work of generations of philosophers and archivists. However, most of the time Guardians of Knowledge fight neither living nor burning foes, and instead vigilantly watch over the Library and its savants. As such, they are very skilled bodyguards and patrollers. In addition, should one of them become a commander thanks to the Divine Name ritual, he could be of great use thanks to his mastery of fire, astral and earth magic as well as his ability to train a new Guardian of Knowledge each month; furthermore, those that don the Master Librarian Girdle will receive knowledge of astral magic even if they did not previously possess it."

#descr "Scribe Fencers are low-ranking Archivists that have mastered the art of scroll-fencing. While they spend most of their time copying books and scrolls for the Library's usage and haven't yet proven themselves enough to be entrusted with more important activities, they still are erudites and thanks to their very uncommon skills are sometimes called on the battlefield to support Isphenople's heavy troops from a short range. Although slashing scrolls are too expensive for general use in the nation, Scribe Fencers know how to use simple writing quills as deadly magical swords and darts. Like Archivists of greater rank, they are covered in magical parchments whose invisible wardings protect them against mundane attacks but make them more vulnerable to fire, and also like them, they make good use of their spare time to perfect the mastery of their art, which makes them stronger under sloth scales but weaker under production scales. But since they all are scholars whose discipline requires years of learning, Scribe Fencers are rather rare and hard to recruit in great numbers. Still, should one of them become a commander thanks to the Divine Name ritual, he could be of great use thanks to his mastery of air, earth and astral magic as well as of his ability to train a new Scribe Fencer each month."

Like regular Nightmares, Baetyl Knights are powerful combatants that inspire great dread on the battlefield, but also like them, this comes at a very high energy cost, meaning that their art is extremely taxing and can make them vulnerable. However, unlike other Nightmares, Baetyl Knights are armed with the most sacred and powerful weapons of the Onyx Tribe: lances, armors and shields made of an eerie black stone fallen from the Stars. Thus, they are among the most heavily armored troops of their age, and more importantly, their attacks will destroy with their dark radiance all that is holy to their enemies, making them especially powerful against sacred units. Finally, they are exceptionally well trained, as shown at the same time by their fighting skills, their exceptional endurance in the practice of their exhausting art, and their ease at patrolling the deserts that surround Saqaba. Baetyl's mystical energies being easier to channel in lands of death, Baetyl Knights will be less expensive to train where life dwindles; however, being the elite of Nabatem's military, they won't be easy to find outside the capital."

#name "Baetyl Eidolon"
#descr "A Baetyl Eidolon is the guardian spirit of a baetyl, that is to say, a black stone fallen from the sky and often made of either obsidian or a dark, meteoritic iron. In many cultures, but more than in any other place in Nabatem, baetyls are considered sacred as the alien messengers of divinity and as immaterial celestial beings' homes and sanctuaries. In Saqaba in particular, where the desert seems to attract such meteors and where they are sometimes used as precious, holy materials for temples or idols, baetyls are worshipped as direct signs and manifestations of the awakening God, and therefore it is no surprise that their spiritual inhabitants are venerated as tutelary deities. These beings are what we call Eidolons, which means mirror image or shadow, because they mostly manifest through the dark and silent reflections on the polished surface and edge of black mirrors made from onyx, obsidian or meteoritic iron and used to divine their will and that of the God. Still, should someone profane their altars, they would become hostile and directly influence the material realm with their horrifying presences. In such cases, or when used in their crusades by the Amazons, Baetyl Eidolons can be very dangerous beings. Although individually they are pretty weak, they still are almost impossible to harm by mere mortals, due both to their ethereal nature and their perfect invisibility without the use of black mirrors. In addition, even if they somehow were destroyed, their beings would soon reform an aetheric body inside the meteoric stone to which they are bound, and as such they seem to be perfectly immortal. Thus, being immaterial and indestructible, it's only natural that they cost no upkeep whatsoever. Since the mystical powers of baetyl stones are easier to draw in lands of death, Baetyl Eidolons also are more common in such environments."

In more ancient and uncivilized times, many could be found in the region of Nabatem, where they lived in seemingly unlimitedly vast mazes of red caverns in the ochre desert, where it is believed that they primitively worshipped the supernatural guardian spirits of strange geological structures called fairy chimneys, that some people nowadays associate with Baetyl Eidolons. But the time came when the Onyx Tribe was forced into exile, and it wandered until it reached this place and its particularly hospitable caves. The Troglodytes were chased down mercilessly and eventually hundreds had to leave the belly of the earth to live like mere animals under the sky. For this reason, it isn't rare to find savage Troglodytes in the wastes not far from Nabatem. Although they can be violent, they are easy to track due the trail of devastation they leave in their wake, and the Amazons know they would be foolish not to use them as slaves, either as beasts of burden or living war machines. Thus, they can be recruited in every waste and cave near Nabatem, as well as in the capital where all kinds of slaves can be found easily."

Their warriors are the ruthless bodyguards of the Queens of Apsum and had sacred status until recently, when the city-state abandoned the Rephaim's worship. Now, unlike those of Berytos, they are entirely mundane although still formidable combatants. However, thanks to the old tradition of their training as the military elite of Apsum, they are more numerous and thus less costly. In addition, they are very used to patrolling the desert and will be more efficient both at surviving wastelands and striking down rebellion."

#descr "Tribal peoples of the wild follow their shamans and totemic spirits. The Bone Tribes are despised by other tribes as they have abandoned the animal spirits and turned to cannibalism and necromancy. Bone Tribe Hunters adorn themselves in bone charms that give them some protection from malign magic. Living like nomadic scavengers in the wild, barren lands that surround Nabatem, several Bone Tribes became unexpected allies of the Onyx Tribe and could very well serve it in war, provided that the region is sufficiently sick to attract their opportunistic minds and maintain their foul spiritual practices. Although the Amazons merely tolerate their existence and that of their non-matriarchal ways, they still know that some strong similarities exist between their peoples - in particular their great interest for the mysteries of death and their ruthless society forged by the fire of foreign hatred and unhospitable lands -, and as long as these savages avoid the cities and holy sepultures, they are considered useful and sometimes even directly supported in their efforts. Conversely, these Bone Tribes themselves rarely hesitate before catching the opportunities that the Amazons give them, and as such, they consider themselves a lower, more hidden and rustic, but certainly no less important part of the kingdom of Saqaba itself. Nabatem's Bone Tribe warriors and shamans are particularly independent and, unlike non-national ones, cost no upkeep whatsoever. Although they can't be recruited without a summoned Desolate Presence to unite them under its worship in their province, members of Nabatem's Bone Tribes will spontaneously appear in provinces controlled by the Lost Necropolis where a dominion of Death is strong.

#name "Bone Tribe Beast Hunter"
#descr "Tribal peoples of the wild follow their shamans and totemic spirits. The Bone Tribes are despised by other tribes as they have abandoned the animal spirits and turned to cannibalism and necromancy. Bone Tribe Beast Hunters are prominent warriors that have proven themselves by single handedly slaying a ferocious beast. Like other Bone Tribe hunters they adorn themselves in bone charms that give them some protection from malign magic. Living like nomadic scavengers in the wild, barren lands that surround Nabatem, several Bone Tribes became unexpected allies of the Onyx Tribe and could very well serve it in war, provided that the region is sufficiently sick to attract their opportunistic minds and maintain their foul spiritual practices. Although the Amazons merely tolerate their existence and that of their non-matriarchal ways, they still know that some strong similarities exist between their peoples - in particular their great interest for the mysteries of death and their ruthless society forged by the fire of foreign hatred and unhospitable lands -, and as long as these savages avoid the cities and holy sepultures, they are considered useful and sometimes even directly supported in their efforts. Conversely, these Bone Tribes themselves rarely hesitate before catching the opportunities that the Amazons give them, and as such, they consider themselves a lower, more hidden and rustic, but certainly no less important part of the kingdom of Saqaba itself. Nabatem's Bone Tribe warriors and shamans are particularly independent and, unlike non-national ones, cost no upkeep whatsoever. Although they can't be recruited without a summoned Desolate Presence to unite them under its worship in their province, members of Nabatem's Bone Tribes will spontaneously appear in provinces controlled by the Lost Necropolis where a dominion of Death is strong. Temples can also be built to increase their numbers."

#name "Bone Tribe Head Hunter"
#descr "The Head Hunters are the ruling elites of the bone tribes. They lead the bone tribes in attacks on the animal spirit tribes as well as civilized men. They feast on the flesh of men and are feared and despised by all. Their bone charms are made from the bones of wise men and mighty enemies, and are stronger than the charms worn by their lesser kin. The Head Hunters are sacred to the bone tribesmen.

#name "Singing Stone"
#descr "Singing Stones are the most common of megaliths, and they are small and crude enough to sometimes be confused with regular rocks and stones. This illusion, however, does not stand a detailed examination, for in addition to their unnatural standing position, they are always accompanied by many others, with which they form strange shapes and figures over vast areas. Most of the time, their disposition is either circular, linear or grid-like, and thus, they seem to delimit a territory within which the laws of the mundane world no longer apply. Like most other megaliths, they have always existed and been feared or worshipped by living beings, even before the Geodetic Awakening, that simply let them progressively recover their sentience. Legends say that Singing Stones are guardians of the lands of the Dead and that the Veil that separates the Two Worlds becomes extremely thin in their vicinity. It is also said that weird faeries and goblins called the korrigans live below Singing Stone alignments or even themselves take the shape of such monoliths during the day, only returning to life at night. But more recently, darker rumors about them have started to be heard. Many people are disappearing in the barren fields over which the Singing Stones watch, and each time, a new Singing Stone seems to appear. It is whispered that anyone that profanes the sacred stone fields of Karanaac will be cursed for the rest of their lives and changed to stone to keep watch over the fields forever. But the fields are growing a little more every day, and soon, the living won't be able to avoid them anymore. Although Singing Stones are useless by themselves, they are almost indestructible and hold a great power when numerous enough. As long as no-one desecrates them, they bear good luck and mimic the framework of the sky, thus preventing bad events from happening; but their principal use to Karanaac resides in their ability to join its great communions, helping their casters tremendously."

In times of war, they can be put to direct use by letting them operate one of the most powerful mundane weapons known to man, an incredibly clever device known as a mirror lens and whose secret is still jealously kept by Cyanautha's leaders and scientists. By astutely redirecting and focusing light on a single point, Engineer Apprentices can use these wondrous arrays to burn away dangerous foes - a slow but very precise process that is entirely inefficient underwater but can pierce armor and blind mortal eyes in a small area. In spite of their great impact in battles and of the fact that the nation's only ranged weapon rests in their hands, Engineer Apprentices are very few in number, for their complex training requires a lot of time and investment as well as very specific infrastructure. Just like clockwork soldiers and siege golems, Engineer Apprentices can only be recruited if a lab and a Mage Engineer are both present in the province."

Helote soldiers have abysmal morale and need to be whipped into coercion by Tyrants or human taskmasters in order to fight effectively."

#selectmonster 3140 -- Gigante Warrior
#name "Gigante Warrior"
#descr "The Phlegran Gigantes are the descendants of semi-divine Gigantes, who once allied with the Telkhines and declared war upon the Pantokrator. Punished for their hubris the Gigantes were cursed by a celestial decree. Although they are among the largest and strongest of remaining giants, they have lost much of the discipline and skills of earlier times and their bodies show signs of the curse. The curse has also made them violent and easy to anger. Phlegran Gigantes are frightening to behold with long hair and serpentine scales covering their legs, and their bodies have become resistant to heat and poison. While their Tyrants still wear armaments crafted by the Elder Cyclopes, most Gigante Warriors wear simple armor of leather and metal scales. Gigante Warriors are arrogant and proud and never take command from human-sized generals. In their hubris they believe themselves above the gods and they force the population to worship them."

As a result, many scholars assume that they are united for the most part and in this time and day work together towards a single goal, which disturbingly appears to have recently become the eradication of mankind; but there are others still who fear or trust that great wars may have been waged in Heaven in the past and possibly still to this day between several immense angelic empires, sects or coalitions and that the Litany of Cinders is but one of them, even though no one besides the other pretender gods and their own servants seems to have descended yet to oppose its global invasion. In any case, Bethel She'em's angels are organized following a strict vertical order divided in nine classes and thus named the Ennearchy. The lowest of these ranks is nameless just like most of its members, who are usually tasked with delivering messages, singing the glory of the Lord and acting as infantry in battle. Since angels mostly lack the mortals' ability to carve their own path and destiny through free-will, they are by themselves completely incapable of overcoming their fundamental nature and of changing their metaphysical identity. In spite of this, and even though the angelic hierarchy is primarily based on innate individual worth, by distinguishing themselves by their deeds all angels may be chosen by the God, undergo Transubstantiation and reach a higher dignity. By doing so, a nameless angel will first be christened and awarded with a heavenly horn which can smite enemies and bring great zeal to allies."

The Witch Kings have unnaturally long lives and few remember how they first rose to power. Most likely their strength and sorcery is a gift from supernatural forces. The Witch Kings introduced cannibalism and manflaying to the Sauromatian people. Feeding on one's fallen enemies is only practiced by the Androphags, but manflaying is a widely accepted practice in all of Sauromatia. The Witch Kings use flayed-skin standards and wear skullface masks. They are truly horrible to behold."

#name "Hekateride"
#descr "The Hekaterides are female Daktyloi, semi-divine beings of the sunken kingdom of Therodos. Unlike their male counterparts, they are not of dwarven stature, but tall, slender and beautiful. They are the inventors of dance and gave their skills and blessings to the human inhabitants of Therodos. During the Telkhine reign the Hekaterides gave birth to a race of goat-like half-men. The Daktyloi disclaimed paternity of the satyrs, denounced their sisters and secluded themselves in caves and hidden forges. The satyrs were expelled from the realm and hid in faraway forests where they eventually were found and adopted by the Panii. The male Daktyloi were always reclusive and concerned themselves more with their crafts than with humans. Their Hekateride sisters on the other hand were very much involved with the human population and became queens and priestesses under the Telkhine God-kings. With their sacred dances they brought joy and fertility to the lands. Now the Therodian ghosts follow them in death as they once did in life, dancing to the clamor of cymbals. With their kind words, music and dance they relieve them from the suffering of the Telkhine curse, thus attracting its survivors, healing the sick among them and restoring fertility to the land; as such, even though it will never be enough to return Therodos to its former glory, population will automatically increase by roughly a hundred per month in all provinces where at least one Hekateride is present, provided that these provinces are under friendly dominion. In addition, Hekaterides are able to cast the Transformation ritual."

In the last initiation, the Rite of Three Gates, a Reborn enters the Underworld and immerses himself in the black waters of that dark Realm. If he returns, he is given a crown and full authority as a Sauromancer. The Sauromancers discovered the secrets of dark magic in ancient times and the magic of Death was prudently practiced during these times. However, when Ermor stole the secrets of life and death and perverted them, the Sauromancers knew that swift destruction would soon follow. They decided to aid the priests of C'tis with advice and prepare the kingdom for the coming catastrophe. Sauromancers are very powerful Death mages with some skill in Nature magic as well as other magic paths. In fact, they are even capable of casting the Transformation ritual. The immersion in the black waters of the Underworld gives them great resistance to poisons and almost impervious hides."

But their might and fury would not be contained, and the mountains started to spew fire and molten rock.

#spr2 "Hellenika/ShackledSmith2.tga"
#name "Shackled Smith"
#descr "Four kinds of Cyclops are known by the Arcoscephalean scholars to exist in this world. First, there are the mighty Elder Cyclopes, cousins of the Titans now very few in numbers, most of which were killed or imprisoned after the defeat of the Telkhines, but some of which still help the Gigantes of Mekone and Phlegra with their wondrous crafts to this day. Then, there are the Younger Cyclopes, their degenerate progeny, who inhabit the plains of Phlegra in a wild state but have become civilized soldiers in Porphyrion; Cyclopes of this kind are free even in the land of Oppressors, and they willingly serve their masters. Those of the third kind, the monstrous Earthen Cyclopes, truly are the most mysterious of their great race, for they predate even the Elder Cyclopes and represent the origins of all other kinds; these very powerful mineral-skinned giants were born from the roots of great mountains in primordial times and have now almost completely disappeared from the world. Finally, there are pseudo-cyclopes, that is to say one-eyed giants of all other kinds, the best known and numerous of which clearly are the denizens of Agartha, the Pale Ones.
Shackled Smiths deeply differ from other Porphyrian Cyclopes in that they are of the Elder kind rather than of the Younger one. As such, they are of much greater size, strength and intelligence; but the difference doesn't stop there, for as the ancient allies of Phlegran Tyrants they also are hated all over Porphyrion. Thus, in Porphyrion there is a strong opposition and rivalry between Cyclopes of these two kinds, and when at the end of the war against Phlegra the Oppressors ordered their soldiers to capture and enslave all remaining Cyclops Lords, the proud Younger Cyclopes obeyed gladly. Now, all Elder Cyclopes in Porphyrion are Shackled Smiths magically chained to the Oppressors' dungeons and forced to serve them by forging superior armaments for their lesser kin as well as the cruel tools of their own oppression."

#descr "Most of the Trophimoi are human students that come to Phlegra to study ancient lore, but some unscrupulous individuals come to gain personal power over their fellow men. Several generations ago, before Porphyrion's revolt, the Phlegran Tyrants received an unusual visitor in the person of Phlegyas, the Theurg Tyrant who, in his exile from Ermor, decided to join and serve them in exchange for power and famously created the iron headbands since then used by the Oppressors of both Phlegra and Porphyrion to subjugate oppressed communion slaves. Following that tradition, Trophimos Oppressors capture and train promising youngsters in the use of magic. The young mages are shackled with arcane bonds that place them in a forced communion led by the Oppressors. The Oppressors wear iron headbands forged by the Elder Cyclopes that allow them to dominate arcane communions and the Shackled Ones."

#name "Oppressor General"
#descr "The Oppressors were originally the ones who, under the domination of Phlegran Tyrants, enslaved human mages with magical shackles. When they revolted against the Gigantes and told the human slaves that they would free them, they gave them armaments suited for killing even the mightiest of Gigantes and the Porphyrian armies were born. But the Oppressors didn't really intend to free their slaves, and thus they saw the need for strong leadership. The Cyclops commanders, regardless of their claims, were not very good strategists. Some Oppressors made themselves captains and generals of the slave soldiers. After the war, being used to dominating the shackled mages, they observed a lack in loyalty among their soldiers. With the aid of the Elder Cyclops they had enslaved, a new form of shackles was forged and the first Iron Bound were chosen. Oppressor Generals are Oppressor mages that have chosen a martial career. They are superior to the Cyclops Commanders, but can only command human soldiers."

While mankind toil and serve, the Cyclopes live existences of ease, serving the Oppressors as their ruthless soldiers in exchange for their privileges. They occasionally wage war upon inferior races, but most of their time is spent honing their skills and bullying the human population. The Cyclops Commanders claim that they are the equals of the Gigante generals of Mekone, but in truth their success in battles stems from the strength of their soldiers rather than from their strategic skills. Hateful of all Gigantes for being better than them in every way, they'll do anything in their power to preserve Porphyrion's oligarchy and follow the Oppressors in their conquest and destruction of both Mekone and Phlegra."

#selectmonster 3224 -- Cyclope Soldier
#name "Cyclops Soldier"
#descr "In earlier times Porphyrian Cyclopes lived pastoral lives herding mouflon sheep on the gentle slopes of mount Ethna, but even during these times they sometimes were coerced into joining the Phlegran Tyrants' armies. When the Tyrants, too sure of their rule's sustainability, started fighting each other for petty reasons, their control over Porphyrian provinces dwindled. The human and Cyclops populations took that opportunity to rebel against their masters and together tried to capture the great fortress of Telepylos once built by the Tyrants to oversee the lands they conquered. They suffered incredible hardships, but their brave attempts shook the very fundations of Phlegran rule, in the end forcing the Tyrants to retreat in order to avoid similar revolts in other parts of their empire and reinforce their control over its remaining slave populations. Thus, Porphyrian humans and Cyclopes successfully expelled the Gigantes out of their lands. Jealous and hateful of their greater cousins the Elder Cyclopes, who had willingfully served Phlegra against them, Porphyrian Cyclopes gladly obeyed their new human overlords when they ordered to capture the region's few surviving elder smiths and to shackle them under the fortress that was once theirs. When the lords of Porphyrion eventually unveiled their intentions as Oppressors, they wisely decided to reward their mighty Cyclops soldiers with influence and power, thus ensuring their loyalty. They were given arms of cyclopean manufacture and became a noble warrior-caste tasked with enforcing the Oppressors' absolute control over the human population. Created by enslaved smiths, the cyclopean armors are not as splendid as those used in Mekone, but they are superior to most other armors. Cyclopes are known for their fondness for throwing things, large and small. In Porphyrion where they have been gifted with armaments forged by their greater kin, javelins have replaced the boulders carried in Phlegra and by their ancestors."

#selectmonster 3228 -- Oppressor Archon
#name "Oppressor Archon"

Since the days of Phlegran domination there have been oppressors with greater powers than their peers, but only after the Tyrants' demise were they able to grab power. Since then, they have manipulated the Cyclopes into fealty, further developed the Theurg Tyrant's sinister creation and invented new ways of dominating their fellow men. The Oppressor Archons are skilled mages ordained as high priests. Their magic knowledge is considerable and the iron headbands that give them command of the communion of the shackled mages provide them with almost godlike powers. The Archons rule Porphyrion with an iron hand."

Their whole authority being based on their strength and fighting abilities, they appear almost invincible to other sciapods, and although it is indeed very hard to defeat these half-giants in single combat, as soon as they lose a duel, their power crumbles and they are likely to be replaced by a stronger champion. Still, becoming a chieftain in U is earning a great number of privileges, among which the right to wear regal furs without being looked down upon, protecting their owner from cold and light blows. Indeed, while in U clothes are usually considered to be for the weak, when none but the greatest warriors of the nation is able to strike you down, it is clear that you have attained the epitome of muscular might and no longer have anything to prove; therefore, even though it is still necessary to remain the strongest in order to keep your lieutenants in check and avoid being overthroned, only a fool would doubt your physical shape or demand to see it directly. In addition to being the most common of blemmye commanders, sciapod chieftains also have the privilege to be trained by the Sophotatos or Anthropophagos shamans of their tribe and are thus gifted with a very faint magical aura, an essential skill for a chief since it allows them to lead protozoons and other magical beings in battle."

#descr "The most voracious, cruel and perverted of the Epiphagoi, their shamans and leaders are notorious for only eating sciapods and humans, particularly relishing in devouring such delicacies as their brains, hearts and eyes, and as such, they have very well earned their name: the Anthropophagoi. Although they are as primitive and violent as their minions, they are much smarter and have some magic knowledge, which makes them vastly more dangerous in more than a way. Entirely devoting their intelligence to the defilement and corruption of all that is pure, orderly or beautiful, they conspire against their enemies with the ultimate goal of making them suffer and eating them, and they use all their powers to do so, seldom hesitating to send to oblivion their numerous underlings, whose loyalty they ensure by fear of the supernatural and of fates much worse than death. Some scholars even suspect that the Anthropophagoi may have played a decisive role in the fall of Pedoseion, the third King of Elemental Earth that is now known as Father Illearth and worshipped by them in a gory and barbaric cult that even other sciapods consider heathenly. While it is true that their presence often impacts negatively the region in which they dwell by spreading unrest and causing some population losses, they are extremely cheap blood mages and their dark rituals are one of the most powerful weapons of U, which explains why the Satraps tolerate and even sometimes cooperate with them; still, they are strictly forbidden direct participation in the religious rituals of U, and as such, their priestly authority will be reduced if they are ever appointed as prophets."

#name "Priest of the Palm"
#descr "While sciapods eschew technology and often live as troglodytes, the least uncivilized of their tribes still have a proper culture - a language, a society, a religion, rites, arts and traditions. As the holy representatives of all that makes sciapods a noble race, the Priests of the Palm, leaders of the Dancers of the Foot, are highly respected by all true sciapods in U and may even be seen as wisemen by some humans. Above both the Strong - chieftains and their champions, who retain their power at a local level but must recognize them as envoys of the Satraps as well as obey the directives they deliver in the name of the Great Unifier - and the Weak - mere tribesmen, who see them as the best of their kind, their glorious protectors and the chosen of the God, promised to bring them happiness by making the utopia of Mu a reality -, they form a third caste along with their blessed followers and, as such, are the greatest guarantors of U's unity before a single, common and sacred goal. While they share with the Anthropophagoi the ability, rare in U, to use magic and are sometimes ordered by the Satraps to cooperate with them, they are antithetical to them in many ways; indeed, these sacred gymnasts are benevolent, very disciplined and clearly more learned than most other blemmyes. In peace, they officiate in most of the rituals that aren't restricted to the Satraps themselves, take an important part in the nation's research for the keys to the mystery of Mu, and when available teach tribesmen in the temples, an important task since it allows them to spend the month training a new Dancer of the Foot for free; and in war, they demonstrate their unique priestly science by using holy semaphore against their enemies and sacred oils to magnify their soldiers' bodies, two spells they are famed for even beyond the lands of U. Still, they are forbidden by their jealous masters to overstep their role, and as such their priestly authority will be reduced if appointed as prophets."

For this reason, these animals are sacred to the priests of U - a status facilitated by the fact that, just like blemmyes, they only have a single foot and no discernable head -, and a rare species of giant, subterranean, fungivore snails which also exists in some marshes of the sunlit world has been bred by the sciapods for as long as they can remember. Almost brainless and therefore very resistant to fear and magic, these terrifying war snails have a highly corrosive saliva which can cause both flesh and steel to melt, and their almost formless body has impressive regenerative properties. Although they are generally slow, they feel at ease in swamps - which remind them of the muddy environment of their caves - and have no issue surviving underwater. In addition to ensnaring their aggressors in very sticky and somewhat poisonous slime, their moist body makes them highly resistant to fire and poison, albeit vulnerable to lightning and cold climate. But this weakness is no matter for them: when they are hurt badly enough, they temporarily retreat inside their shell and wait for their wounds to heal, which is rarely more than a matter of minutes. While they are entirely unable to act in this state, they also are very difficult to harm and are almost guaranteed to eventually recover if not killed quickly, which makes them highly dangerous opponents indeed."

#name "Satrap"
#descr "The highest sciapod authority in all of U along with the Gavagai Kings, the enigmatic Satraps - also called Bishops of Delirium - are second only to the God and the Mu-Atlaï themselves. As the most direct interpreters of the Primogenitor's ktonian Dreams, they have developed an utterly strange holy science in order to understand them. Called 'Pataphysics - always starting with an apostrophe -, that serendipitous and hyper-paranoiac-critical discipline could be defined as the branch of metamagic philosophy which extends as far beyond metaphysics as the latter extends beyond physics, or in other words, the science of imaginary solutions, which symbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their virtuality, to their lineaments, and especially the science of the particular, that which examines the laws governing exceptions. Armed with this highly advanced and superrealistic knowledge, the secretive Satraps ascended to power in U long ago, directed the unending blemmye wars against Agartha, prophesied the coming of the Unifier, and now, will do all that is in their power to bring the rise of U to its ultimate conclusion: the reshaping of the world into the imaginary empire of Mu. Although they aren't very skilled in traditional magic, they actually have immense powers that could pass unseen at a first glance. The most important one is by far their ability to cast the majority of the highest rituals of U, including those summoning Terminae and Mu-Atlaï; and while these rituals could theoretically be cast by other mage-priests as well, in practice it is extremely rare for non-Satraps to be able to do so. In addition, only they have the expertise and the rank required to use a very mighty magical item, the Sacred Shell, and they rarely summon monstrous Sacred Snails when in friendly dominion. Finally, they know how to cause madness with a mere touch and they are such powerful priests that they automatically cast Fanaticism at the start of every battle."

#name "Gavagai Chieftain"
#descr "A Gavagai Chieftain is the leader of one of the many perpetually warring Gavagai tribes, much rougher and meaner than regular Gavagais. By strength and will alone, he subjugated several other blemmye giants and built his clan out of nothingness, just as his clan will once again dissolve into chaos as soon as he knows defeat. While too stupid to rule over blemmyes of lesser size but greater numbers and intelligence, Gavagai chieftains still are highly respected by sciapods and inspire them awe, as they are as strong and tall as the mountains themselves, and when they stop struggling against each other to sing in unison for their next in kin, the Mu-Atlas Titans of legends, the long echo of their voices seems to cause the whole earth to shiver before the mysterious power and the strange beauty of their lament. Although the influence of Gavagai chieftains is very limited in itself, there is an important reason why they so clash against each other; for once or twice per century, it happens that a Gavagai so mighty, cunning and heroic as to unite under his grasp his entire kin in the region comes to deserve the uncontested title of King and build cyclopean monuments to his own glory such as those that still litter U millenia after their death. Therefore, after winning countless battles, a Gavagai Chieftain has the chance of being recognized as a Gavagai King, thus granting him with many powerful skills. By doing so, he'll receive some mastery of Earth magic and priestly powers above that of a Priest of the Palm, as well as a very powerful area of effect weapon and enough fighting mastery to cast spells in melee without faltering. But the greatest mark of his unyielding authority will by far rest in his unique ability to construct great fortresses for the whole blemmye race to admire and use in warfare."

#descr "Megatriskelioi are triskelioi of great size that strangely attract protozoons and therefore often lead hordes of lesser mindless blemmyes to destroy everything in their wake. Like regular triskelioi, they are strange creatures born from the spontaneous aggregation of three leg protozoons. Considering the fact that legs and arms are equally common among protozoons, the existence of triskelioi is inevitable, since sciapods - the most numerous of sentient blemmyes - have two arms for one leg. As such, triskelioi are widely believed to be formed of the many legs in surplus. Still, their generation doesn't follow any preordained plan, and just like protozoons, with whom they share most of their qualities, they are completely devoid of intelligence. Since their entire body is made of nothing but legs, triskelioi are known in the lands of U as one of the fastest terrestrial creatures in existence. In order to avoid losing balance, triskelioi never walk. Instead, unable to ever stop their course, they continuously roll forward not unlike a wheel, and when numerous enough they mindlessly trample everything in their path, repeatedly kicking with great agility, speed and strength anything too large to be climbed over."

#descr "In the temples of Zun, the highest of Vestal priestesses tend to the eternal Flame of Justice. Most, however, instead celebrate the holy Blood of womanly self-sacrifice. Those among them that completely devote their lives to the sublime and invincible power of Femininity become Sacred Prostitutes. By doing so, they abandon their priestly authority forever to instead themselves become embodiments of passion and objects of adoration. Although their daily life then consists of appeasing the pain and urges of the Amazons by sharing their warmth with them, they can also serve the God by seducing men, thus causing their downfall as castrated slaves and once again proving the superiority of women. While their sacred task forbids them from wearing any other armor or clothing than their thin veils, delicate perfume and refined jewelry, they are protected from harm both by their great beauty and by the God, which allows them to make fine assassins as well in the case where they would fail to sway their target's heart. However, carving their precious jewelry and distilling their bewitching perfumes isn't possible without the help of magic, and thus they can only be recruited in provinces with a laboratory."

#descr "Amazons of the Garnet Tribe are even more warlike than those of the other tribes. Their military is renowned both for its discipline and for its ferocity. Garnet Commanders are the result of this great predominance of war in the society of Zun: experienced and brutal warriors that were rewarded for their skills with the right to lead a small squadron in battle. Being accustomed both to the order of the phalanx and to the chaos of the battlefield, they are skilled, pragmatic and charismatic leaders, respected both of Hoplites and Furies, and they are very efficient in their tasks, especially that of patroling and hunting fugitives, which makes them very useful even in times of peace as roughless agents of the secret police. However, they are quite numerous in the armed forces of Zun, so they aren't allowed to lead as many soldiers as the commanders of rival nations."

Their skills are instrumental to many of the sacred rituals through which the nation is destined to glory, and their magical experimentations are vital to their sisters' health, thus allowing their mere presence to prevent the most dire consequences of a lack of blood medicine in the region. In fact, all High Vestals who saw their skills in Holy magic empowered by an item are even considered as prophets for that purpose. Clearly, as the architects of magical cloning and of the Zunnite society as a whole, more than any other mortal they are to thank for the emergence of Zun's utopia."

This is mainly due to their wide use of gryphons originating from the Spire of Justice as sacred mounts; but a less known fact is that the royal stables of Zun train elite purebred drakon riders whose rare mounts are famed in the whole world for their near-perfection as beasts of war and parade. Close relatives to fire drakes, Zunnite drakons are huge, scaly reptiles capable of breathing fire like dragons as well as running with the speed and agility of a jade lizard. Although they are rather stupid and cruel creatures, they still are very disciplined due to the special training they received since birth at the hands of the expert Amazon breeders of the Zunnite drakon studs, located in remote desertic regions or sometimes in deep magma caves where drakons can easily be obtained through blood magic experiments on wild fire drakes. Due to their great prestige, members of the royal Drakon Cavalry are considered sacred, but because of the highly magical nature of their mounts a High Vestal must be present in the province to recruit them."

Elite warrior maidens with great skills and experience of the battlefield, they are famed for their exotic fighting style and all received special training to be able to control the huge Drakon matriarchs they mount in combat, which also allows them to efficiently lead other warbeasts on the battlefield, particularly regular salamanders and fire drakes. Drakon matriarchs are Zunnite drakons of massive size, musculature and weight. Unlike their younger progeny, more commonly used as mounts by the Drakon Cavalry, these formidable creatures, tyrants among their kin, are slow and lazy; however, they are also capable of resisting great violence unscathed, and more than anything, their fiery breath is much more powerful than their offspring's. Truly, Drakon Knights are among the greatest war heroines of the Zunnite military of the present days. Like the Drakon Cavalry they command, they are considered sacred but can only be recruited under the presence of a High Vestal."

#name "Lord of Heroes"
#descr "Many adherents of the hero cults of Makedon are descended from the bloodlines of the ancient heroes themselves. This Lord of Heroes has proven their skill in battle time and time again, and rides a sacred pegasus. Part of the initiation into the higher-tier of the cult of heroes is to participate into a daring raid either on Mount Cephalos or the Amazons of the Crystal Tribe, and steal a beautiful pegasus for themselves. Only the most cunning and daring can sneak deep into the heart of a rival city state, and emerge with such a glorious prize. They are powerful warriors and mages, and inspire feats of bravery from those who follow them into battle."

Although they are disciplined and humble members of their orders, in a way they love freedom and movement as much as the wind from which they draw their inspiration and magic.

For a very long time, the few survivors hid, waiting for the day where someone power-hungry enough would call them back to their rightful kingdom. Powerful blood and astral mages that are hated by the people, they can only be found in Thalamanth, and recruiting them will be very difficult until their old academy, the Areopagus, is reassembled through the right blood ritual, which anyone can do with a sufficient blood sacrifice. Once the Tyrant-Philosophers are in power again, they'll be able to corrupt Thalamanth's Crystal Ark through a truly awful ritual they invented, thus committing the ultimate sacrilege and gaining immense and terrible power."

Once their long initiation is finished, they all master a very wide range of skills. Although most of these skills are useless in warfare, their original talents in magic certainly are not, and since the Crystal Tower's mistress has joined the Awakening God, their loyalty now indirectly goes to Thalamanth, which will undoubtedly be a great boon. A Crystal Astrologer or Psappho herself must be present to teach them their craft."

After the Arcoscephalean Myrmidons turned the tide of several battles against Triliax in previous wars, Triliax's military adopted the unit as its own. Since then, it has become a staple of Triliaxian tactics and the proud Triliaxian Myrmidons don't think of themselves as simple epigones. Like all Myrmidons, they wield short swords and carry shields, but unlike others they also bear magical tattoos that remind them of the sacred horses of Trilios, children of foam, a great symbol of nobility that strengthens them when a High Priest of the Sea accompanies them."

#descr "Physicist Scholars are mage-thinkers specializing in the mechanics of the Mundane and the Arcane alike. Although they could be compared to philosophers, a complicated relationship exists between these sects. The physicists of Triliax existed before the philosophers of Arcoscephale and in fact even before the fall of Therodos, and it is said that the philosophers founded their school in reaction to the physicists' beliefs, which they find too earthly and archaic. Since then, philosophers have become a lot more popular than physicists, but physicists still live in the Divine Citadel which welcomed and protected them when they were cast out of Arcosephale, and now they serve it with all their skills. They study all four elements as the fundamental principles of the universe and use their findings to invent practical things. Therefore, they are very skilled at siegecraft and castle defense. In addition, due to their materialistic way of thought, they are very aggressive battle mages and know how to cast spells twice as quickly as most other mages, which can be quite exhausting but also devastating to the opposing forces."

#name "Pillar of the City"
#descr "The Pillar of the City is an altar of great symbolic importance that can be used by High Priests of the Sea and the Mountain to perform their rituals. It is richly ornamented with jewelry of gold and aquamarine and carved with delicate patterns of vines and flowers which are famed for their beauty and intricacy even in Arcoscephale. Its main function is to remind the people of Triliax of the great miracle of the Sacred Walls of Dardanum and of the inevitable victory of Civilization over savagery. The mere presence of one such pillar is enough to increase the wisdom of savants in the region, and therefore it will improve the research abilities of all friendly mages in the province. Although the pillars can be summoned everywhere, High Priests cannot be recruited outside of provinces of their element. A pillar is also required for the recruitment of Troll Archons in underwater provinces, but it is gradually damaged by erosion while underwater and thus will be rendered completely useless after one year in such an environment. Finally, should a great Telkhine join the kingdom in service of the Basilei, he would be able to fulfill the function of a Pillar of the City for recruitment purposes."

Of the four, three are aspects of Natural Violence and the Wrath of God; they are feared by all, and prayers dedicated to them mainly have the function of appeasing them, in hopes that they won't manifest. On the other hand, the City is the true benevolent aspect of the God of Triliax: the safety of civilization, the marvels of the crafts, the divine walls that were given to man to protect himself from the natural world and the enemies of culture. The High Priests of Triliax represent all these things and therefore are great authorities in many domains, but they focus on either the Sea or the Mountain, for the City is best represented by the Basilei, and the Monsters themselves need no heralds. In this sense, one could say that two churches cohabit in Triliax. Both worship the same God, but through opposite and complementary points of view. High Priests are very confident in the benevolence the God extends to its faithful servants, as well as in their own powers, and unlike lesser priests they will summon without hesitation the Wrath of the Sea and the Mountain upon the enemies of civilization. More than anyone, they understand that there is actually no contradiction between the violence of nature and the order of culture; one is built directly on the other. High mountains and oceanic shores serve the City as much as walls of stone, and therefore being a High Priest of Quakes or Waves doesn't mean being a savage. It is actually quite to the contrary: a High Priest is a representative of Civilization and just like the ancient cyclopes a great master of the crafts, a very skillful mage-smith. Other than their religious authority, High Priests of the Sea bear great powers over water and storm, and sometimes also over the earth. They can be recruited in all coastal forts where a Pillar of the City has been erected for their rituals."

#descr "A Basileus is a direct descendant of the divine hero Trilios, the founding father of Triliax. The Basilei are the holy kings of Triliax, and they receive immense magic and priestly powers from their venerable age, the purity of their blood and the sanctity of their function. Far above the High Priests, they are the great unifiers of the two cults of Triliax - the cult of the Sea and the cult of the Mountain -, and more than anyone else, they represent the most important aspect of the God: the City. They are the heralds of Civilization, the Soul of the Nation, and they vigilantly watch over the Great Walls of Dardanum from their palace in the Divine Citadel. Although their reign is authoritarian and tyrannical, they are admired by all for their leadership bears the promise of unparalleled greatness."

#name "Aristocrat"
#descr "The society of Triliax is very hierarchical. It is widely believed in the Divine Citadel that virtues and skills are before all else a matter of ancestry; some bloodlines are better than others by nature, for the remnants of divinity quickly dissipate with generations. There are some things that cannot be taught; one is simply born with or without them, or at least with or without a great potential for them. This is not only the order of nature, but also that of reason and the city. Therefore, it is no surprise that the idea of democracy and rule by the unwashed masses is despised in Triliax. Because of the importance placed on the purity of blood, the Triliaxian theocratic monarchy also bears a large aristocratic class - that is to say, a class of leaders chosen for their innate, hereditary ability, moral merit and qualities -, which is centered on the preservation of the power of a few dynasties that usually have some old ties to local divinities or sometimes even to Trilios himself. These high-blood families are composed both of myrmidon warriors that value honor, bravery and loyalty above all else, and of frail intellectuals that prefer taking the fight to the field of words. The latter often become politicians and are what the people of Triliax call Aristocrats. They are useless in battle, except for commanding troops. They don't have enough experience of combat to be great tacticians, but they bear enough authority to ensure that slaves won't rebel. However, Aristocrats are most skillful as province administrators. Not only do they gather taxes even when no fortress is present, but they also very efficiently organize static defenses. A wise Basileus should not underestimate the utility of such governors."

#name "Monster Cyclops"
#descr "Cyclopes are one-eyed and stone-skinned giants sprung from the roots of antediluvian mountains, and those from Triliax are even more monstrous and frightening than others of their kin. Some have always lived along the steep and rocky coasts of Triliax, even before the fall of Therodos. They also are the reason why this region remained uncivilized until the arrival of Trilios: their great violence is frightening to men, and many sailors and adventurers found death by unexpectedly encountering a Cyclops' den. The hills of Dardanum are a sacred place to Cyclopes, because rather than being of natural origins, they are in fact an old tumulus that serves as a cemetery for their kind. Conversely, Cyclopes are themselves sacred to the people of Triliax: as the most perfect of all monsters, they represent all monsterkind and therefore one of the three aspects of the Wrath of the God. Without the monster cult of Triliax, never could men have built a kingdom in the region of Dardanum; but since Cyclopes and Triliaxians serve the same God, they cooperate and form a single force. Monster Cyclopes are commanders of the Monstrous Phalanxes and lead their brethren in battle. They are even more gluttonous than inferior Cyclopes, but they are also smarter and stronger and can destroy or repair stone fortifications with ease. Unlike the True Cyclopes and gigantes of Mekone, who despise them as savage and degenerate beasts, Monster Cyclopes have lost most of their noble ancestors' traditions, but even then they still practice blacksmithing, in unison with the priests of the Sea, the Mountain and the City, and under the vigilant watch of the Basilei that defended their honor and sanctity by giving them a homeland to serve. Having fought beasts and monsters for the control of the lands since the dawn of time, they bear great authority over animals and can tame even the wildest monsters. Their natural cruelty also makes them easier than most commanders to empower in Blood magic."

#descr "Troll Archons are ancient Kings of the Sea Trolls who joined the great Triliaxian Basilei after their conquests of the sea. They willingly exchanged their crown and their sunken kingdoms' secrets for great riches and the promise of even greater glory. These powerful sorcerer-generals possess unimaginable wonders of Water magic and may grant humans water-breathing abilities if they accompagny them. A temple, a laboratory and a Pillar of the City are required to recruit them in underwater forts, and the strong sea currents will inevitably damage Pillars of the City with time over the course of a year spent underneath the waves, until replacing them becomes necessary. Short of all these requirements being fulfilled, Troll Archons may also be summoned."

They fly at such heights and for such long distances and periods of time that scholars suspect that they are able to sleep on the wing, even while gliding far above earth or the oceans. As such, they make extraordinarily good scouts, and if needed their excellent sight also lets them patrol or find supplies very efficiently."

Never ever tired nor compliant, they cause unimaginable chaos wherever they go, most of the time for no reason at all, and rare are the animals that are considered more noxious and destructive than them. The Republic in the Clouds doesn't care about their anarchic ways and gladly uses them to spread the word of revolt or to instill disorder in enemy territory. In fact, they are even encouraged to harm concurrent cults, a new way to annoy others that they revel in, and as such serve an important purpose for the Nation of the Birds: starving the gods of the faith of their worshippers."

As such, they are often chieftains of the savage although impressively clever bird tribes formed by the most intelligent winged species. Usually wilder and more defiant against civilization than their black counterparts, most Superior Hawks that heard the call of Nephelococcygia decided to rally their tribe to the Revolution and to lead it to war against mankind; therefore, just like more important commanders of Nephelococcygia, they are naturally admired by lesser birds but don't get along very well with humanoids. Finally, they are great hunters and are able to somewhat efficiently organize the search for supplies for the ravenous and sometimes even destructive flocks of Warriors of the Clouds they lead."

Bird Shamans serve as tribal spiritual guides and, while reclusive, they are often very wild and aggressive towards any humanoids who stumble upon them. Since the rise of Nephelococcygia, this dislike of mankind has been harnessed by the leaders of the Republic in the Clouds to inspire revolt against mankind among lesser birds. This plan has worked, and now Bird Shamans accompany them to war. Although they are too savage and unstable in appearance to make good leaders, they are talented song-weavers and use their intricate whistlings to conjure spells of great beauty and subtlety. A good title to summarize their status would be that of cruel artists."

#descr "For most of their historical existence, since they acted naturally according to the divine will and thus didn't have to worry about the gods, birds didn't have any use for priests. When the Pantokrator disappeared, this changed. The subjects of Nephelococcygia no longer are heralds of the Pantheon, their flight no longer bears any other meaning than that of the impending fall of mankind. Instead, they glorify their own divinity and claim confidence in the fact they are the new gods. Thus, when the blood of a man was first spilled upon the holy ground of the City in the Sky, a new order of Priests of Birdkind was founded. While they still are as uncivilized as Bird Shamans and Superior Hawks, all Manflayers bear within them the holy Oath of Nephelococcygia against Mankind and the Gods. They have no use for words or diplomacy; the only way to teach wingless mortals their place is by example, by spilling and drinking their blood. Thus, although they are able to preach, when doing so they will always kill a part of the population in their gory rites. Manflayer Birds are the spiritual leaders of all Blood-drinker Birds and tell the other birds of the Golden Ones that bathed in the Blood of the Sun. Those among them who are clever enough to master blood magic are talented in finding suitable slaves for holy sacrifice."

#descr "After Bird Sorcerers, Ancient Owls are the most intelligent of entirely natural birds. They spend most of their time in contemplation of the mysterious truths of nature and the sky and before the rise of Nephelococcygia it was very rare to meet them directly without searching deep in the forest or the mountain for their hidden abodes. All of them know human speech, and although they eschew civilization and the products of the craft, they are powerful mages with the mystical knowledge to equal any human wizard. It is said that they were taught their lore by the Treelords and Sky Trees at the very dawn of time, and as such they were often considered important representatives of the natural world and their wisdom was respected by the elder druids and shamans of Ulm and Marverni. But recently, things have changed; most Ancient Owls have agreed that man must pay for his impudence and have joined or even sometimes actively encouraged the Revolution of the Birds. Now, they are among the most common of the great leaders of Nephelococcygia, and they cooperate together with a vast mutual respect, loyalty and understanding, allowing them to achieve a great efficiency. Although they can only be recruited the traditional way in the capital, they can also be found as teachers and governors of all provinces with a Circle of Knowledge. Such a site will automatically appear in each fort that is controlled by the Republic, is under its dominion and is equipped with a laboratory, and will remain for as long as these conditions are met. While any commander can enter it to learn from the Owls' wisdom, as long as it is an Owl that enters it, one month out of two on average one of its peers will join the nation for the same gold cost as usual. Additionally, an Owl prophet will always be empowered in all its known paths of air, nature and astral magic, but such Great Wise Owls can also appear spontaneously at the doors of Nephelococcygia to bestow their immense wisdom upon the Nation."

Solar Birds are supernatural beings imbued with the essence of the sun. They shine like angels and anyone daring to strike them risks losing their eyes forever. They are almost immune to the elements and entirely unaffected by storms. An intense holy aura surrounds them and they are able to fight like dragons and cast powerful divine spells at the same time. Although their personality is too cold, stoic and impervious to change to allow them to lead living beings, they have a telepathic link with magical entities and are able to command them in battle. Like Spirits of the Four Seasons, Solar Birds are able to attack with flashes of blinding light, burning the eyes of their foes, and their internal energy seems to be inexhaustible. Solar Birds require half the upkeep they normally would as their perfect body has very few needs. A Solar Bird prophet will gain one additional priest level compared to other prophets."

#descr "Although the savants, leaders and librarians of Isphenople are usually human, they are only a minority in the ancient city. Most of its population is actually still of C'tissian origins, as it descends from the people of Isphi. While the C'tissians of Isphenople prefer to live peaceful lives as farmers, fishers, crafters and traders, they still have to defend their homes in case of war. They are skilled at surviving swamps and the desert, and like all C'tissians, they have a thick hide, innately resist poisons and are able to swim accross rivers. They however aren't very skilled in combat, and they actually are notorious for their cowardice. Since they expect their human leaders to protect them against invaders, they rarely volunteer in the military and ask for high wages in spite of their general inefficiency. As a testimony to their hybrid culture, they wear Ermorian bronze scale cuirasses but use falchions and round shields of C'tissian design instead of the tower shields standard to the Isphenoplian order of the Guardians of Knowledge."

#descr "Archivists are simultaneously erudites, diplomats and adventurers that form a great order at the center of all Isphenople's activities. Unlike the savants that come to Isphenople simply to make use of its precious books, they are men of action and loyal agents of the Ancient Library. Their goal is simple: to gather knowledge and record historical events for the Ancient Library. As such, they travel all around the globe and serve as the eyes and ears of the Scholar Citadel, ever-vigilant of all opportunities, including taking possession of old manuscripts, exploring ancient ruins to unearth forgotten secrets, or following important figures to write down an accurate account of their lives and actions. Although they are mostly pacifists interested only in the unlimited acquisition of knowledge, they are ready to employ every tool in their arsenal for this purpose, including lying, scheming and making use of their powerful mind-magic. While it is certainly true that they aren't warriors and despise physical violence, they consider the progress of science and mankind to ultimately be far more important than a single life and are very able to defend themselves if necessary thanks to the magical and martial art they created: scroll-fencing. This exotic fighting style makes use of scrolls and quills as shields and swords, and requires an expertise both physical and mystical that only Archivists, Gnostics and their disciples possess. Thus, typically covered in magical parchments, books and writing material, Archivists are permanently protected from mundane attacks by invisible wardings, but are very vulnerable to fire."

#name "Keeper of Secrets"
#descr "Keepers of Secrets, or Gnostics, are members of a very secretive order that is officially dedicated to classifying newly acquired knowledge and watching over the most precious scrolls of Isphenople. In truth, Gnostics are more than just librarians: they are the true power behind the Library and worshippers of a Divine Mystery so high and unutterable that it can only be described as a Dazzling Darkness. Gnostics all share the same goal: achieving Gnosis, that is to say Supreme Knowledge. They believe that reaching such a perfect truth shall allow them to transcend their own nature and that such is the will of the Awakening God for its faithful. To ascend towards Gnosis, a Gnostic must undergo several successive rites of initiation, each time reaching a higher rank in the Order and learning more of its mystical secrets. Thus, most members only know a very small part of the sacred Truth that they worship. Still, they serve their order with great zeal and discretion, and the few mysteries that they have been allowed to contemplate give them the power to chase down the forces of evil. As such, they are the priests of Isphenople and their sacred archives are its temples. Just like Archivists, they are protected by magical wards inscribed on scrolls that serve as their armors, but unlike them they rarely adventure outside the lands of Isphenople and do not master the art of scroll-fencing. In addition, they can cast Communion Slave even without knowledge of astral magic, and thus join a mystical communion with the masters of their order, and they can receive additional astral magic power from items even when they haven't already mastered astral magic."

#descr "Keepers of Highest Mysteries are the masters of the Gnostic Order. They are members of the cult that have reached the highest of its ranks and thus had access to the Sealed Vault hidden below the Inner Archives of Isphenople. None except they know what resides within that Vault, but it is whispered that, there, they had the chance to see for themselves and contemplate the Dazzling Darkness of Gnosis in its whole splendor, and that this changed them, healing them from their humanity by burning it away from their souls. Some also believe that they unlocked the Secret of Immortality, and no-one has yet been able to prove this false. In any case, Keepers of Highest Mysteries demonstrate some very weird and powerful abilities, and although it is hard for the profane to recognize them and differentiate them from lower Gnostics, they truly are superior in their mystical might. Not only are they extremely powerful priests capable of deciphering the Thrones of Ascension's secrets and riddles, they also are in possession of such immense knowledge that, should they undergo a ritual of Empowerment in any path for the first time for that path, they would gain two more magic levels than normal in the process. In addition, should a Keeper of Highest Mysteries become the Awakening God's Prophet, he will receive one more priest level than normal. Finally, as the ritual masters of their Order, they will always lead astral communions in battle. Although Keepers of Highest Mysteries do not usually share their secrets, those that were empowered at least once will be able to unearth new ones with great ease and thus gain incredibly vast research abilities."

#descr "Arcadeians have always been a pastoral people of shepherds. Therefore, shepherds can very easily be found on the slopes and vales of Arcadeia. Although the most experienced among them can make good guides for troops in uncivilized lands, their greatest use in war besides scouting resides in their ability to assemble herds of goats. These animals can then be used either as a way to produce supplies for regular troops or as emergency troops themselves. Like all Arcadeians, shepherds are peaceful hedonists and will be stronger in lands of sloth. In addition, their great independence allows them to cost half the upkeep they normally would."

They spend their lives traveling from a village to the next and chanting their stories as a gift of wisdom and beauty to their countrymen. Such poems and songs vary widely in content; some are tales of epic battles and adventures through the world, others are hymns of joy and veneration to nature and its beloved spirits, others still are practical counsels about life, love, or the natural cycles. But all are sacred to the people of Arcadeia, and thus rhapsodes all have priestly powers, even though a temple is not required to recruit them. Like all Arcadeian priests, they can receive increased priestly powers by using ancient rhapsodies crafted by astral magic."

#descr "Lychantropos Kings are the offspring of Lykaon, Pandora's brother and a great tyrant that reigned over Arcadeian humans long after her disappearance. He was beloved by his people and accomplished great deeds in its name, but prosperity wasn't enough for him as he couldn't forget his sister since she had received divine punishment for her mistakes. As a result he secretly hated the nymphs - the semi-divine guardians that were tasked with keeping mortals away from Pandora's memorial and the products of her misstep - and he dreamed of vengeance against the Pantokrator. So he devised a plan to trick the Great One, soil his sanctity and prove his servants that his power had limits, so that a great rebellion could begin against him. Convinced of the fact that the Pantokrator wasn't really omniscient, he killed one of his own sons and served his flesh as a dish to the Pantokrator during a feast he had prepared in his honor. Should he have succeeded, he would have shown all lesser deities evidence of the Pantokrator's weakness, all the while defiling his pure light, the greatest symbol of his power. But in truth, the Pantokrator had intentionally feigned ignorance so that Lykaon would believe he could be tricked and would commit such an unforgivable crime. Falling into his trap, the ancient king was punished for all eternity along with his offspring, and since then he and his remaining sons have been cursed with the grotesque attributes of a half-human half-wolf body. Humiliated and dishonored, Arcadeia's Kings no longer have any real political power. Still, they are respected by the denizens of the Valley as the bearers of a noble and heroic blood and as the symbols of a past whose darkest moments have been erased from all but a few memories by the nymphs and their dreamlike gifts. These semi-divine werewolves still resent the nymphs to this day. Although they hide their true feelings and obey their watchers, they can call lesser Lychantropoi that spread heresy and chaos."

#name "Bone Reader"
#descr "Although it is possible that the shamans of the Bone Tribes once encountered the Enkidus of the swamps of Ur - which after all aren't located exceedingly far from Nabatem - and learned their ways from the wild men, they also clearly share some cultural traits with the Amazons of the Onyx Tribe, and it yet remains to discover whether this is a simple coincidence or the sign of common origins. They call themselves Bone Readers and their magic is similar in many ways both to that of Enkidu shamans and Onyx sorceresses. The Bone Readers make bone charms for the warriors of the tribe and prepare the cannibalistic feast held after a victorious battle. Like lesser members of Nabatem's Bone Tribes, Nabatem's Bone Readers are attracted by lands of death where they can more easily practice their dark shamanism, and they cost no upkeep whatsoever. In addition, as Nabatem's Bone Tribes are more nomadic than those that dwell outside its sphere of influence, their chieftains and shamans also are somewhat competent warleaders. Of course, practicing cannibalism on a ritual level, they sometimes know how to use blood magic - a secret that they're willing to share with the Amazons. Finally, a few of them were illuminated by the ever-growing influence of the Awakening God and gained priestly powers or additional powers over death through the ecstatic worship of some Dark Rock Fallen from the Stars or the tending of some ancient mausoleum once built for a now forgotten royalty of Saqaba. Although they can't be recruited without a summoned Desolate Presence to unite them under its worship in their province, members of Nabatem's Bone Tribes will spontaneously appear in provinces controlled by the Lost Necropolis where a dominion of Death is strong. Temples can also be built to increase their numbers."

#descr "Zunas, sometimes called the Blue People or the Lazuli as well, are a rare species of blue inorganic humanoids whose natural habitats are the most arid and hot deserts of the world. They usually live a nomadic lifestyle in small, reclusive tribes, the most powerful of which is called the Ifinagh tribe. Zunas are believed to have a liquid body composed mostly of magical water, and as such they are extremely resistant to fire and have a natural affinity for water magic. Although they can easily breathe in aquatic environments, their bodies also have a tendency to lose some of their matter to the currents and to meld with the ocean. Therefore, Zunas' health quickly deteriorates when underwater, and it is almost unheard of for one of them to survive more than a year in such a place. It is for this reason that Zunas usually choose to stay in the desert: they don't have any difficulty surviving in the wastes, even in the absence of food, and they know that no other place is more hospitable to their kind. Although the Ifinagh exist as a nation free from oppressors, other weaker Zuna tribes have been entirely enslaved by the Onyx Amazons of Nabatem, who find their race very useful for their innate powers over water. Members of such tribes do not revere the Awakening God and secretly hope that the Inifagh will one day come to free them. In addition, as slaves, they have very low morale, and since their mastery of magic does not come from scholarship, they make quite poor researchers. It even may happen that some Zuna slaves escape from their masters and run away in the desert where human beings would have trouble following them, and if the capital was ever captured by the enemy, he would receive the help of one additional Zuna for free every month as long as the city has some province defense. Illuminated by the Awakening God, the Zuna Betrayer no longer is a slave or a heretic and willingly serves the Onyx Tribe. He has a great morale and increased powers over water."

#name "Unearthed Consort"
#descr "An Unearthed Consort is the dried husk of an ancient king of Nabatem, that is to say, the spouse chosen by an Amazon Queen to accompany her in eternity. In Nabatem, polygamy is the norm for women of power. In addition to their female lovers, they generally have an entire male harem at their disposal, and although their men are usually slaves, they still must fit many different criteria, such as external beauty, good health, a learned mind, talent, docility, respect, and a general nobility of heart. But those are only the required conditions to enter a great priestess' or sorceress' harem and avoid being taken by a lesser nobility instead, or worse, becoming a non-recreative slave, a worker or a soldier, as is the case for the majority of captured men. Although becoming a royal concubine by entering a harem is hard and reserved for an elite, it isn't the end of potential hierarchical ascension for slaves, for every harem is shaped by its internal competition between slaves to become the one and only Consort. Indeed, when the harem's mistress is particularly satisfied by one of her concubines, she can choose to enfranchise him and to either give him a position of high servant as a paid eunuch or, in rarer cases, declare him as her eternal spouse, her Consort, and make him the closest thing there is to her equal for a male. In both cases, the chosen concubine only receives a very limited, although very real, amount of freedom and becomes respected as a true, although not fully independent, member of his royal house. When finally time comes for an Amazon leader to enter the Necropolis and be enthroned as an Eternal Queen, she brings with her her entire harem and her Consort is compelled to follow her, gaining with her sacred status and immortality. Such a Consort is then called King and can even receive limited political responsibility as the bearer of his Queen's sacred Will and supreme Authority. Consorts can only be recruited in presence of their Queen."

#descr "As we know, below Saqaba lies a vast, ancient and multi-layered necropolis; but that isn't the last of Nabatem's secrets, for below that very necropolis also lie other things. One, if not the most important of them, is a cold and black river that leads straight to the Underworld, and whose still waters are enchanted with magical properties, such as powers of divination or immortality. Thus, after their discovery of these mystical caves far under the Necropolis, the Amazons of the Onyx Tribe developed in Nabatem a new caste of priestesses and sorceresses that other independent Onyx Amazons do not share with them. These mystics are called Stygian from the name of the sources of the Underworld. Stygian priestesses are a more secretive and deliberately humble order than that of usual Onyx priestesses, and thus have a lesser spiritual status. They are silent women that refuse temporary power to study the waters of eternal sorrow and ritually mourn the dead without an end. That is not to say that they are pacifists or condemn murder, far from it. Instead, they find nobility in the suffering of separation between the living and the dead, and want to cultivate that nobility as the most beautiful and meaningful thing in the world. Of course, peace definitely also is something they revere, but pain, to them, is in the natural order of things and shouldn't be considered the enemy. In a way, it even is sacred, and that understanding is what lets Stygian priestesses use their powers. For they aren't simple priests indeed. Not only are they able to read glimpses of the future in the subterranean currents, but by mourning the dead and following the stygian flows until a path to their lands opens before them, they can under specific circumstances call them back to the land of the living, and in particular they can return their God to the sunlit world far quicklier than other priests, according to the Divine Will and the fluctuations of the River of Souls."

They learned their arts from the Kokythiai, nymphs of the Underworld, and since their return to the sunlit world they bear great magical powers and arrogance. They love to take part in every battle, inflicting suffering and death with great joy and cruelty, all the while showing their almost naked beauty behind their entire lack of armor. As such, most unlike Stygian priestesses, Stygian sorceresses are as exuberant as they are cold and quickly became the major war mages of Nabatem's kingdom, which is undoubtedly a great advantage in spite of their costly and luxury exigences, for they are mighty spellcasters, as can be seen in their ability to conjure a temporary water gem at the start of every battle. In the very end, those that proved themselves the best shall be chosen by the Unearthed Queens of Saqaba to be enthroned and reborn as one of them."

In the ancient times, when the Onyx Tribe first found Saqaba and its antediluvian Necropolis, its sorceresses studied these mysterious places of power with great fascination and interest, which led to the discovery of mystical secrets such as the one that started the Unearthed Queen's dynasty and is still being used today during their enthronement. Now, although new upper layers of Amazon origins were built in the since then fully appropriated Necropolis, the Unearthed Queens still continue their research devoutly, hungry for power, knowledge and the glory of their Awakening God, and with each of their steps in that progress they grant new weapons to their kindgom. As such, for as long as either an Unearthed Queen or one of her Consorts is entering one of Nabatem's capital city's sites, there is a small chance that they will find a great treasure of magical gems of Death, and even more wonderful relics may be found if both members of such an eternal couple are entering these sites simultaneously - one of them studying a Baetyl Obelisk for mystical secrets, and the other one challenging the deadly traps and guardians of the Carved City with these very secrets as his or her weapons."

#name "Queen of Apsum"
#descr "Unlike Berytos, which is otherwise very close to it culturally, Apsum always was ruled by descendants of the mighty Machakan Lion Queens of the great race of Mababwe. Called 'Colossi' by the historians of Arcoscephale, they are truly superior to ordinary men and bear a divine heritage in their blood. Their Queens are sorceresses of great power and adopted the bloody cult of the Melqarts long before Berytos, although in a very similar fashion. But times change, and due to its close geographical proximity with Nabatem and relative isolation from other nations as well as to its comparable traditions of matriarchal rulership and slavery, Apsum's exchanges and ties of partnership with Saqaba have never ceased to grow. In parallel, its other neighbors have considerably expanded their terrorities in recent times and became increasingly hostile before that small city-state. The great queens of Apsum are so proud of their divine ancestry and glorious history that, when they felt their precious independence threatened, they started to question the cult they themselves had led to power. Thus, it only became a question of time before they agreed to betray their faraway Rephaim masters and joined their forces with their cousins of the Onyx Tribe. Accepting their exotic baetylic cult was a small price to pay to share with Saqaba a common destiny, for the Carved City too is in need of allies and more than anything else wants to stay strong and autonomous. Now, the Queens of Apsum are glad to learn their new religion and to rediscover some forgotten parts of their own past in the lost mausoleums of Nabatem. Although they no longer have any priestly power or sacred status, they still are great masters of Blood magic and outstanding military leaders. In addition, each is at all times accompanied by two blood slaves like personal pets ready for battlemagic sacrifice, and they are so loyal allies of the Lost Necropolis that they may end up deserting when controlled by other nations."

#name "Onyx Lithomancer"
#descr "Onyx Lithomancers are powerful yet reclusive Amazon smith-mages that draw their powers from the mountains, and forge, sculpt and carve stones both through physical and magical skills. They are priestesses of the Earth and consider onyx, obisidian and baetylic iron as sacred materials linked to Strength, Stability, Purity and the Underworld. Although they are rare and prefer to practice their art in loneliness, they undoubtedly are one of the greatest strengths of the Onyx Tribe, to which they usually stay loyal and from which they receive great honor, and more than one Onyx sorceress learned her talents by becoming a Lithomancer's apprentice. Although they dislike purely intellectual tasks and thus aren't exceptional researchers, they still are very powerful mages and start all their battles with a temporary earth gem. In addition, they craft tools and weaponry for their patrons and are the origins of the renowned Onyx Amazons' heavy armaments, therefore naturally producing resources in the province where they're located. While it is true that some reside in the red canyons of Saqaba itself, Onyx Lithomancers can also be found in all of Nabatem's highlands and mountains and are usually recruited there to allow for a more efficient use of the capital's infrastructures."

According to legends, they taught the druids of Marverni how to awaken their warriors' hidden potential by inscribing magical tattoos on their skins. They possess subtle magical powers that can be increased to tremendous proportions with the help of great choruses of singing stones and menhirs. As such, they are the primary mages and priests of Karanaac and are trusted by the Geodetic Awakening as reliable nodes and transmitters of its sacred Will across the world wide harmonic network of stones."

#descr "Speaking Stones are sentient megaliths of black, polished granite and huge size that are carved with a symbolic, minimalistic and unmovable face representing their soul and gifting them with speech. They are powerful guardians of the Underworld whose enigmatic words bear terrible charms and curses. Their crude and eerie resemblance to human beings gives them an uncanny and paradoxically inhuman aspect, underlining very well their alien, unforgiving personalities. Although they are very rare, they are still deeply feared by mortals, and for good reason: in addition to their great magical might and priestly authority, they are known to possess strange and unique abilities, such as that of cursing with dire bad luck anyone who touches them. Thanks to their rudimentary humanoid features and to their subtle mastery of language, they are also more able than other megaliths to preach as well as to use magical items. Finally, should they be threatened, they know how to release spirits of the dead to defend themselves and their holy ground."

#name "Dolmen"
#descr "A Dolmen is a complex megalithic monument composed of at least three different stones, among which at least one, the Table, is roughly horizontal and covers several of the others. Thus, most dolmens have the general shape of a door without walls, and this is no coincidence, for dolmens are known by druids and mystics to be gates to the Underworld and the korrigans' kingdoms. With the Geodetic Awakening, like other kinds of megaliths, Dolmens have started to gain sentience, and while it is true that each stone retains its own soul, the Dolmens' are fused into a single consciousness through the Polyphony of Stones. Like menhirs, dolmens are sacred to Karanaac, even though they can be erected without temples - and as such, they are often used to build temples in faraway provinces. In addition, since they are often located close to stone fields of great size and are inhabited by very powerful spirits due to their internal polyphony, they can be used as commanders for a great number of troops or, more classicaly, korrigans, menhirs and singing stones - an ability that isn't shared by most other megaliths. Incidentally, their great wisdom can be used for fairly efficient research. Finally, their presence is necessary to recruit most of the Armaerix Tribe's sacred warriors and sages, provided that one of their Oppidums or Stone Circles is present in the province."

#name "Cairn"
#descr "Cairns, or Thinking Stones, are uncommon megaliths composed of several medium-sized stones arranged in such a way that removing a single of them would probably be enough to unbalance their ensemble. As such, they are symbols of perfect harmony, their cooperation being necessary to their stability. Similarly, although each of their stones is inhabited by a very primitive and simple spirit - alone almost inert and incapable of complex thought -, when put together, a common consciousness of a higher level than those of most mortals emerges from their meditation. And reciprocally, the same kind of equilibrium can be found between different cairns themselves; for they very often form vast geometrical figures in the landscape, so far away from each other that they wouldn't seem linked without looking at a map, but also so intrinsically connected that their mystical conjunction and entanglement causes the whole province to participate in the Geodetic Awakening. All these facts, when put together, explain why Cairns are exceptional researchers yet not sacred to Karanaac, and why only a specific number of them can efficiently take part in Karanaac's mystical reflections, that number being at all times equal to the intensity of Karanaac's dominion in the province. It is worth noting that Thinking Stones are also much more sensitive than normal researchers to Drain and Magic scales, even when compared to the other magically attuned megaliths of Karanaac."

#name "Wise Figure"
#descr "A Wise Figure, or Korrigan King, is the petrified body of a great korrigan elder chosen to reign over a small faery kingdom beneath the earth, halfway between the Underworld and the Sunlit World. Although they are close cousins to other megaliths, Wise Figures have different origins, and thus aren't sacred to Karanaac. They look like the sturdy, stout statues of bearded dwarven beings and actually have two different faces, one on each of their sides, so that they are able to watch over the crossroads and passageways between both Worlds, as they were instructed to do by the Elder Stones. Many legends speak of children, adventurers or wizards that fell in deep holes while following the korrigans out of reckless curiosity or hunger for power, were then led to their Kings and had to answer riddles to escape with their lives; it is also said that those that survived, either through wit, purity of heart or trickery, went back home with incredible secrets and soon became rich and mighty by using them astutely. It is now evident that at least some of these legends are true, for Korrigan Kings are full of incredible wisdom and spend their almost unlimited time weaving elaborate and often cruel jokes and enigmas, oblivious in their games to even the most basic needs of their human friends and victims. Thus, it is no surprise that Karanaac makes good use of them for research purpose, and although they are unorthodox parts of the Geodetic Awakening, there is no doubt that they are zealous servants of Awakening God."

#descr "Elder Stones are huge megaliths of polished black stone in which an incredibly ancient spirit of immense power has been sealed for all eternity by the last Pantokrator for having threatened his authority. Standing in mute circles in Karanaac like dark, immutable guardians and pillars of the sky, they may very well be the greatest megaliths of the world both in sheer mass and in mystical might, and their immeasurable age and wisdom naturally caused them to become the true architects and masterminds of the Geodetic Awakening, second only to the God himself. Each Elder Stone is engraved with a single symbol of either benevolence of malevolence called a triskele, and the Elder Stones' innate attunement to creation and destruction is so great that their triskeles perpetually glow with a dim, supernatural light whose color depends on the personality and magical alignment of the spirit that inhabits it. There are therefore four main types of Elder Stone, three of which receive hugely increased skills in either Earth, Astral or Nature magic, and the last of which receives moderately increased skills in all of these magics as well as in the path of Death. A given Elder Stone's type isn't predictable in any way before it has awakened, and once it has been declared it can only change through the great ritual of Reawakening."

#name "Astral Megalith"
#descr "Astral Megaliths are needle-like stone structures that are said to be as ancient as the world itself. They are also called Pillars of Creation due to the fact that their geometric positioning seems essential to the very stability of the world as a whole, somehow linking it to the higher Spheres of existence in a great cosmic concordance between the vast and the singular. Although their exact original purpose is unknown and unfathomable to mortals, some posit that together they act like a metaphysical shield that protects the Earth and all of its inhabitants against the great Horrors that dwell in the Void beyond the stars; while others claim that, on the contrary, they are proof that the Earth itself is a prison and a containment cell for some mysterious force, and that mortals are but insects whose destiny is irrelevant to this divine undertaking. In any case, with the Geodetic Awakening, Astral Megaliths have started to adopt a new purpose, and their universal communion now serves the God of Karanaac. Their world-wide alignments grant them an incredible power that manifests itself both through their immense sacred influence, able to spread dominion with ease, and through their ability to extract astral pearls from cosmic energies. And although the Astral Megaliths are too ancient and inhuman to communicate in comprehensible ways or even at all, which means that they leave all mundane matters to the Elder Stones, they very probably are the most important and mighty beings in the Polyphony of Stones."

#name "Insular Sorceress"
#descr "Cyanautha's territory still comprises many islands, and although most are tiny and hold only a few small settlements - often villages that were built on the remnants of the highest mountains of the sunken empire -, these islands are numerous enough to be home to the majority of the nation's population, like a vast constellation whose many fickle stars would as a whole shine like the sun. Yet, many of these islands are almost entirely uninhabited, and for good reason: they often shelter the lonely and almost immortal disciples of an ancient sorceress-heroine, one of the Fifty, who is known for her tragic destiny and the terrible curses she cast upon those that bored or annoyed her even in the slightest. Therefore, any traveler would be well advised to whenever possible avoid setting foot upon the sand of the least civilized of Cyanautha's isles, for it is likely that just like their feared mistress, the insular sorceresses of the present have great powers and cruel charms. In truth, in spite of these frightening rumors, the sorceresses still are loyal to their nation and its God, and they'll gladly unchain their magic to spell the doom of those that threaten their beloved archipelago and its people. With the right magic paths, Insular Sorceresses are capable of casting the Transformation ritual."

#name "Geronte"
#descr "Since Cyanautha rejected its Telkhine masters, its political system changed dramatically. The monarchy was abolished and replaced by an oligarchy which combines both tyrannical and democratic aspects. Now, in Cyanautha, with the exception of the Awakening God, only man commands man, and the nation's leaders always have to keep in mind the best interests of the people and to work for the greatest glory of the nation as a whole. Only the elders, or Gerontes, are allowed to bear citizenship, and thus they rule everyone else with an iron grasp; however, they are first and foremost fatherly priests of the God and the people, and although they are privileged, very strict rules dictate their powers and their rights to ensure absolute fairness and a functional system, for corrupt and chaotic individualistic behavior is widely considered shameful in Cyanautha. Every day, the Gerontes must take part in the Boule - an assembly that possesses judicial, legislative and limited executive power - to decide through vote and random sortition who among them will be allotted with the most important responsibilities for that day. As such, they are skillful orators and administrators, and only they have the necessary authority to organize the great undertaking of producing and managing the resources that will then be used by the military to complete the sacred duty of the nation. Although only a few among them have the time to devote themselves to the study of magic, all of them have very learned minds and cause the nation's wisdom to advance through their debates and deliberations. As such, they can be used as researchers and are entirely unaffected by Drain and Magic scales in this task, Production scales instead increasing their general efficiency; and due to the mundane origins of their sacred authority - their political status -, no temple is required to recruit them."

#descr "As everyone knows in Cyanautha, the Gerontes aren't only priests, sages and administrators but must also daily take part in the Boule - an assembly that possesses judicial, legislative and limited executive power - to decide through vote and random sortition who among them will be allotted with the most important responsibilities for that day. But their great importance doesn't stop there, for in the same way, every year they must also elect a few of their peers as their representatives; those that emerge victorious, generally great orators full of wisdom and experience, become Prytanis, or Caretakers, and assume direct leadership of Cyanautha. In doing so, they acquire great priestly and military authority and their magical powers are immensely expanded by the Boule's combined favor. Although the Prytanis still have to obey the edicts of the Boule, for most intents and purposes they are the true leaders of the nation and they have unmatched executive power. In addition to being the mightiest mages of Argolinth and the only ones with the power to imbue hydrelephantine silk robes through construction rituals, they are administrators of immense skill and their presence in overland colonies is necessary to organize the patronage of Mage Engineers and Orphic Mystics. However, since their political role is so different than that of other Gerontes, both kinds of politician are complementary to each other and irreplaceable by each other. In other words, as they are too busy to manage the nation's resource chains due to their own important functions, Prytaneis do not increase production in the province where they dwell and instead delegate that task to lesser administrators whose time isn't as precious as theirs."

#name "Mage Engineer"
#descr "In Cyanautha's dry land colonies, there has been a long tradition of scientific, artistic and otherwise cultural patronage. Each Prytanis likes to improve his image and leave a lasting trace in history by wisely spending the city's resources as well as his personal riches to support the research of a few intellectuals and commission new masterworks. Mage-engineers represent the purely scientific aspect of such patronage and are often chosen to improve the military defenses of a city by undertaking great projects of architecture or golem construction, which makes their presence, along with that of a laboratory, absolutely necessary to the production of khalkotauroi, clockwork soldiers, siege golems and their own apprentices. They are great geometers and mathematicians who study the fabric of the Spheres. Although they aren't very powerful war mages, they still master the mechanics of optics and, by cleverly using mirror arrays, they can burn away dangerous foes by focusing intense light on them - a slow-to-use but very precise weapon that is inefficient underwater but can pierce armor and blind in a small area. Still, the mage-engineers' genius is useless without a sufficient workforce to handle their apparatus, and for this reason their efficiency in research is increased under Production scales and reduced under Sloth scales. Even though mage-engineers aren't sacred, the presence of a Prytanis as well as of a temple of the arts are both necessary to organize their patronage and recruit them."

#descr "In Cyanautha's dry land colonies, there has been a long tradition of scientific, artistic and otherwise cultural patronage. Each Prytanis likes to improve his image and leave a lasting trace in history by wisely spending the city's resources as well as his personal riches to support the research of a few intellectuals and commission new masterworks. Orphic Mystics represent the spiritual and artistic aspect of such patronage; they are sacred poets and musicians of such skill that they have influenced the mystics of Delphanes and contribued to the formation of one of their orders, and some even claim they too have oracular powers. In any case they compose odes to the God and his most faithful lieutenants - both the Heroes of the past and the governors that support them - and as such, they are among the most important priests of the kingdom, those that write the sacred hymns recited in every temple. As the disciples of a legendary hero - one of the Fifty - that used his musical skills to enter the Underworld and leave it unscathed, they follow a tradition of mystic poetry and adopted his ideas of the transmigration of the soul; like him, they are able to follow the hidden paths of the land of the dead and will never truly die for as long as the light of the God shines to guide them to the sunlit world. In earlier times there was not much speculation on the afterlife in Cyanautha, but with the century-long war against the Spectre of Therodos, this has changed and the Orphic Mystics are the result of this cultural evolution. The new perceptions of the soul and the dead have also marked the arrival of necromantic practices, such as the use of curse tablets, and the chants of Rebirth can be used to charm terrestrial animals as well as to summon the blessing of the Styx upon the nation. The presence of a Prytanis is necessary to organize the Orphic Mystics' patronage and recruit them."

Although they are aloof and rarely concern themselves with matters of politics, they maintain a close relationship with the City of a Thousand Faiths, and when they come to Delphanes, they sometimes agree that the principle of Spiritual Unity is perfectly embodied by the Sibyls' Awakening God, and they join the Cerulean Tower to guide lower apes or sometimes share some of their insights with the Orphic Mystics. This is especially likely to happen while a Cerulean Commander is in the capital, as he'll spread the word of the Sibyls to other apes, and those likely will end up reaching the ears of a Gymnosophist. As White Ones, they are white-furred Vanara of the highest of the castes of Bandar Log who are gifted with superior mental capabilities, as well as mages and philosophers who study astrology and the path of Nature. When a White One dies, his soul may transmigrate. Depending on the actions of the White One, he will reincarnate in a lower or higher form of existence. Truly enlightened ones might become one with the Awakening God."

Most mystics claim that this is the workings of a malign force awakening in the deep - maybe some dark Aboleth influence once again, maybe a conspiration of the jealous Triton Kings, or maybe something else entirely - and propose a conquest of the old lands of Pelagia, the mermen's rightful heritage.
There is fierce competition among the royal siblings and most kings occasionally execute their brothers on claims of conspiracy. As a result, members of the Erytheian royalty are also used to the protection of bodyguards and are able to lead them in greater numbers than other commanders."

The High Seraphs have become rulers of the new, secluded kingdom and the old traditions have lost some of their appeal. The Seraphines conduct services, keep alight the sacred flames which they brought with them in their exile, and tend the frost flowers of the ice gardens which they have cultivated in Hararat in the hope of recreating there those of High Caelum. Each frost flower is said to hold the soul of a dead Caelian, and now that the ashen flowers of Ravens' Vale are far away the Seraphines want to believe that the corrupting influence of the Raptors will finally go away. Since their exile, the Seraphines have gained a more martial role. Unlike those that remained loyal to the Eagle Kings, they abandoned the horrible practice of wing cutting and they now instead lead the Immaculate Guards into battle. Seraphines sometimes set up secret cults in human lands. Their wings and beauty allow them to present themselves as angels and divine messengers. When becoming a prophet, a Seraphine will also receive improved mastery of Fire magic if she already has some knowledge of this path and she will bless her entire province with the supernatural protection of winter by starting to spread Cold scales."

When they first appeared it was an event of great alarm and the young kids were contained or exiled. Soon it became evident that it was not a singular event. Other half-men with black hides, mirroring the dark mood of the Vengeful Forest were also born. The half-men of Pangaea were divided and the exiles and the discontent formed an emerging power that threatens the civilized world. The dryad hags are old, sly and harbor a relentless hatred of the civilized world. They have completely lost the beauty-inspired aura of awe of the white dryads, but still are powerful enough to cast spells as if they started every battle with a gem of Death and are even able to cast the Transformation ritual."

Small human populations living near the multiple entrances to the vast subterranean networks of Agartha have been subjugated and in some cases even were convinced by the Ancient Ones' greatness that it was only justice. When the leaders and diplomats of the most loyal human subjects of the Pale Ones first were invited to enter the caves of Agartha, they were awed by the great statues adorning the opulent halls of the Pale Ones and they understood the true glory and power of their blessed masters. The Pale Ones became worshipped along with their great statues, and when the Oracles accepted human veneration, mortal mages formed a cult around them. The Golem Crafters are the leaders of the cult and now also of Agartha's small human communities. They guard those of the secrets and magic wonders of Old Agartha that the Oracles allowed them to bring, defend and contemplate in their temples on the surface, and they perform weak animation rituals as a pious imitation of the sacred power of the Ancients."

When Olms grow old they grow large and wise and whatever their origin the Pale Ones of Agartha revere them and consider them sacred. For ages the Olms have lived apart from the Pale Ones, curiously observing the emerging civilization from their underground streams and ponds. But this changed a few centuries ago when one of their numbers befriended Emberstream, an Agarthan Oracle of Subterranean Waters. Deepthought, oldest and wisest among Olms had previously only been encountered on rare occasions. When Deepthought allied itself with the Pale Ones, so did its kin, and now the Olms of the deeper earth and their Sages aid the Oracles of Agartha. Olms communicate wordlessly and can project images and emotions to other sentient beings. This power can also be used to overwhelm and harm an enemy. As they are allies of Agartha and benefit of a large degree of independence, Olms take care of their own expenses and do not cost any upkeep."

#descr "No one knows for sure who the Immaculate Wanderer is. Some profess that he is a prophet, one of many in these lands, maybe even a messiah. Others claim that he used to be a leper king, who was miraculously healed and abandoned his crown when he found his holy blade or spiritual enlightenment. Others yet postulate that he is an eternal vagabond, older that any surviving mortal kingdom, up until now blessed or cursed with the inability to die, who finally stopped his great journey when the Angels gave him a new purpose after he reached the holy city. Some even believe that he was the shepherd-patriarch of Bethel She'em before the angels came, and that he is the one to blame for their summoning. And many more posit that he is nothing but a beggar and a madman, who got lucky and now serves the Ennearchy of his own accord. Regardless of the truth, the Immaculate Wanderer travels no longer. This extremely zealous, humble and charismatic individual seems to be spending his whole time within the holy city, praying, preaching and venerating those that he calls 'saviors'. He also doesn't seem to possess any earthly belonging, except for a wondrous blade which he uses as a symbol of his sacred mission in this world, and which he seems extremely eager to brandish against the enemies of the faith, should the opportunity arise in the capital. Until then, he certainly won't be of great use to the Litany of Cinders, but for the time being its celestial envoys do not seem to mind and let him freely pursue his actions. In fact, in his extreme fanaticism he might very well end up serving some purpose, whether by design or by accident..."

#name "Tetragrammaton"
#descr "Taking the shape of mystical diagrams constantly ablaze with supernatural fire and blinding light, Tetragrammatons are direct manifestations of Bethel She'em's God and allow the Lord to interact with material reality even whenever He has exiled Himself from it through Tzimtzum. Each Tetragrammaton is composed of four different symbols which together can be read in multiple ways, and each of these combinations is one of the seventy-two Divine Names of the God, the unbearable Shem'ham Phorash. Even though one Tetragrammaton contains only a very limited portion of the God's power, its existence is already in and of itself a miracle worthy of worship, for even simple Harbingers can summon their Lord simply by etching down one of His names. Then, by sole virtue of its profound metaphysical significance, the Tetragrammaton shall spontaneously light up and gain life, speach and influence, thus acting as a mighty beacon for the coming of the Ennearchy into this world.
Although Tetragrammatons are completely immobile, cannot be teleported even with the help of magic and can be destroyed relatively easily in battle, they still are very important instruments of Bethel She'em's glory. Indeed, each month, every province with a Tetragrammaton and a temple will attract at least one Angel, more appearing in strong dominion and Order scales. The chance for additional angels to descend is equal to twice ten percent for each level of dominion strength and of Order above neutral scales, culminating at a total of seven angels per month on average under perfect conditions. In addition, every province with a Tetragrammaton, a temple, a laboratory and friendly dominion has one percent chance per level of dominion strength to attract a Harbinger every month. Finally, every province with a Tetragrammaton, a temple, a fort, maximal Order scales and friendly dominion also has a one percent chance per level of dominion strength to attract a Principality every month."

#descr "Harbingers, or Archangels, are holy apparitions that occupy the second to last position in Bethel She'em's Ennearchy. Even though they are relatively weak when compared to other angels, they still are both magically and physically very powerful by human standards. From the angels of the lowest rank, which only very rarely are Transubstantiated to become Harbingers but much more frequently receive the intermediate promotion and honor of receiving a name and a heavenly horn, they retain this wondrous weapon which destroys undead beings and mortal flesh as well as their winged humanoid shape and radiant aura; but unlike them, they also have high enough sanctity and might to act as lowly officers, priests and mages. They are generally tasked with leading the angelic choirs in worship as well as in war, announcing dramatically important events to mortals, installing permanent outposts in prevision for the coming of higher entities and assisting them in the performing of holy and arcane rituals." -- Michael/Israfel/Raphael

#name "Messenger of Solitude"
#descr "Harbingers, or Archangels, are holy apparitions that occupy the second to last position in Bethel She'em's Ennearchy. Even though they are relatively weak when compared to other angels, they still are both magically and physically very powerful by human standards. From the angels of the lowest rank, which only very rarely are Transubstantiated to become Harbingers but much more frequently receive the intermediate promotion and honor of receiving a name and a heavenly horn, they retain this wondrous weapon which destroys undead beings and mortal flesh as well as their winged humanoid shape and radiant aura; but unlike them, they also have high enough sanctity and might to act as lowly officers, priests and mages. They are generally tasked with leading the angelic choirs in worship as well as in war, announcing dramatically important events to mortals, installing permanent outposts in prevision for the coming of higher entities and assisting them in the performing of holy and arcane rituals." -- Michael/Israfel/Raphael

#name "Virtue"
#descr "Virtues, or Powers, are angelic paragons, living allegories that serve the Litany of Cinders as beacons of light and purity for all lower celestial beings to follow. Cloaked in blazing fires of kindness and equity, they are leaders of nearly unparalleled skills within the Ennearchy, only equaled in holy charisma by the supreme Seraphs and Tetramorphs. They are also divine warriors that wield solar flames both through arcane potency and their resplendant blade, a consecrated sword known as a Flambeau, which destroys any demonic being it touches. Taking the idealized shape of a feminine Harbinger of unimaginable beauty and absolute chastity, they dazzle mortals with the graceful perfection of their physical form as well as with the ecstatic sanctity of their compassionate yet inflexible words and actions. As the metaphysical embodiments of victorious rectitude, gentleness and abnegation, they are trusted to always prevail against corruption and are frequently sent to destroy evil threats before they grow to require the intervention of higher entities. Along with Taxiarchs, who share a similar rank and power level with them, they command the angelic hosts to war and ensure that the Will of the God is done on Earth and in Heaven alike." -- Raphael/Michael

#descr "Thrones, or Wheels, are angels of superior dignity, only surpassed in the Ennearchy by Seraphs and Tetramorphs. Like Dominations, who share with them a similar rank and power level, they abandoned the humanoid shape of their inferiors and instead took on the incomprehensible form of an eldritch celestial entity, in this particular case as a brilliance covered by four wings and surrounded by a blaze like that of the sun, that when unfolded will reveal a wheel intersecting another wheel of gleaming brass, the rim of which is covered by eyes of sparkling chrysolite - a shape more fitting of their primary function, which doesn't require communication with earthly beings. As a result, their mere presence is unbearable to most mortals, and they are only sent to meet them when the goal clearly is to destroy them and that all else failed to do so, the rest of the time remaining in the Celestial Spheres to shine with eternal light, sing with perfect vibrations and guard the Seat of Heaven against metaphysical invaders. Unfathomable and otherworldly, Thrones bear witness to the splendor of the Awakening God and uncompromisingly serve the Litany of Cinders as sentient, magical weapons of incredible might. These lifeless, ethereal entities are so powerful Air mages that they start every battle with three temporary Air gems, and the tempest of fire that radiates from their perfectly serene body at all times is strong enough to rend and tear apart nearly any mortal it touches in addition to shielding them against storms and greatly helping when besieging enemy forts. Finally, their innumerable eyes let them patrol with unmatched efficiency and their immense wisdom lets them advance Bethel She'em's research at great speeds."

#descr "A Solar is a metaphysical being of incomprehensible might sent by the Sun itself to burn the land, dry the ocean and blind mortal minds with its triumphant light. Angels of fire, light and destruction, Solars appear as golden winged fireballs that radiate hallucinating heat and leave only ashes and wastes in their wake. Worshipped by the Garnet Amazons and especially the Disciples of the Sun as the lords of the sands, the guardian spirits of the lands of Zun and the bringers of the end for mortals, they are called Ruby Eyes of the Desert and idolized in their temples in the form of a ruby eye adorned with a thousand wings of gold. When sent by the God to shine over an enemy province, Solars behave as stealthy commanders that spread heat, dominion and insanity; but they are also extremely powerful mage-priests and incredibly dangerous opponents in battle. Should they be killed, they'd explode in a vast deflagration of light and fire."

#name "Singing Diamond"
#descr "Like the higher Tetramorphs, Dominations are so powerful beings that they cannot entirely manifest in the material realm. Instead, Dominations can only project a small part of their body in this reality. In fact, according to a popular conjecture among philosophers and mathematicians, they are dwellers of higher spatial dimensions, and the entity that can be seen and touched by mortals is but some kind of tridimensional section or shadow of the Domination's true form, which cannot materialize in any fuller way. This at the very least explains why the geometrical structure of Dominations seems to be able to change so widely all the while being so impervious to damage, as well as how these creatures can teleport across the world so easily. As a result, scholars believe they understand why Dominations are followed by four singing diamonds at all times: these actually are dimensional reflections of their own self, incomplete manifestations of other parts of their inaccessible body. In addition, should a Domination be brought close to destruction, it would attempt to retreat to the higher planes in hope of protecting its core, thus brutally contracting and temporarily taking the shape of a more vulnerable but harder to reach Singing Diamond."

Like Thrones, who share with them a similar rank and power level, they abandoned the humanoid shape of their inferiors and instead took on the incomprehensible form of an eldritch celestial entity, in this particular case as a colossal, floating, crystalline, everchanging polyhedron, most of the time a perfect octahedron - a shape more fitting of their primary function, which doesn't require communication with earthly beings.

Dominations uncompromisingly serve the Litany of Cinders as sentient, magical weapons of incredible might. In addition to being highly powerful and nearly unfatiguable Astral mages as well as entities of great telepathic power able to directly attack the mind of their foes, the unnatural substance that constitutes their body is nearly indestructible and highly resistant to magic, all elements and even magical weapons. They are also able to teleport at will at almost unlimited distances and they can even impose their might underwater without being inconvenienced by the absence of breathable air. As if this wasn't scary enough, they are at all times followed by four smaller and weaker dimensional reflections of their own self called Singing Diamonds, which are also able to use Astral magic in combat, and when nearly destroyed they themselves temporarily transform into a Singing Diamond in order to attempt to avoid annihilation. Finally, they are attuned to the crystalline nature of the Earth and will receive one additional level in that path if empowered in it."

#descr "Principalities, or Taxiarchs, are intransigeant Knight-Generals of the Celestial Sphere, protectors of the innocent and mighty hands of Justice fully clad in armors of solar gold. Unyielding servants of the Lord, they bring Order with them everywhere they go and strike down sinners, heretics and demons with their divine grasp and exorcisms just as much as with their holy blades. It is speculated by some scholars that no tangible body exists under their impenetrable plate and that Principalities are actually nothing but blazing metal and unwavering resolve. Along with Virtues, who share a similar rank and power level with them, they command the angelic hosts to war and ensure that the Will of the God is done on Earth and in Heaven alike. Although they can be summoned from the offerings of gold to the Holy City's temple, they cost no upkeep and can also be attracted by Tetragrammatons for free under specific conditions. They are extremely hard to defeat by mere mortals, but until their full essence is confined within their physical vessel thanks to Empyrean Chains conjured by Fire or Earth construction magic, anyone who succeeds in piercing their nearly flawless armor and aura will risk destroying them in a single strike - a vulnerability which must be taken care of as soon as possible."

#name "Prester King"
#descr "The Prester King is the most magnificent king alive. Having lived for centuries he has guided Ind to greatness beyond any other kingdom. By sending his Bishop Generals to assist the kings of heathen nations, he will not only bring great prosperity to both parties but also gain information from the foreign lands and spread the dominion of the Lord in the process."

#selectmonster 3287 -- Bishop General
#name "Bishop General"
#descr "In Magnificent Ind every soldier is a priest and every commander is a prelate. The Bishop Generals are high ranking priests and commanders of the Prester King's armies. Were they known outside the borders of Ind, they would be famous and admired by all, because no other nation has such competent commanders. Sometimes, they are sent as holy delegations in foreign lands to assist the kings of other nations and spread the holy word of Ind; such an event is usually greatly beneficial for both involved parties. As a result, any Bishop General controlled by a nation other than Ind will generate twenty pounds of gold per month both for his controller and for Ind, in addition to giving Ind scouting informations about the province where he is located and to spreading Ind's dominion; however, only up to one Bishop General per province per month can perform such a task as an advisor, and being besieged by independents or being in presence of a Bishop General controlled by Ind in the same province will also stop the delegation from completing its mission."

#descr "Monumental statues of living starstone and immutable harbingers of oblivion, the Baetyl Titans may be the Eternal Queens' ultimate weapons - constructs of apocalyptic power animated by the unhallowed will of unnameable entities which first had to be awakened through the utter shattering and absolute desecration of immeasurably potent magical sites such as the Thrones of Ascension themselves. Shaped after the antiquated representations of long-forgotten, unholy gods from the darkest depths of the Lost Necropolis, the Baetyl Titans more importantly are the physical embodiments and end results of the Onyx Amazons' great doctrine, the very same one which triggered their age-old exile to Saqaba: Through Woe And Ruin Alone Shalt Weakness Be Abolished - it is only through violence, hardship and suffering that one's flaws may and must be destroyed, it is only through ruthless torture and brutal denegation of the self that one will harden and become immune to the shortcomings of the flesh and mind alike. It is therefore no surprise that shaping these Onyx Colossi took such a tremendous sacrifice on Nabatem's part: in a terrifying gambit against the entire rest of the world, the Amazons had to profanate one of its most important sanctuaries to imbue their creation with its antediluvian energies; and while it could indeed appear at a first glance that by doing so the Necropolis' sorceresses forewent immense gifts in the form of resources and blessings, in truth it logically follows from their ideology that all they did was Destroy their own Weaknesses by sparing themselves and the entire world the possibility that someone else would claim these founts of magic and use them for much greater evils. In any case, their enemies now should tremble, for the Baetyl Titans, resonant in viscous thought, thread the world from now on, cloaked in unbearable might. Sheutekh, Lord of Malice, is one of them and must be banished should the Dark God of Nabatem be stopped from ascending."

Shaped after the antiquated representations of long-forgotten, unholy gods from the darkest depths of the Lost Necropolis, the Baetyl Titans more importantly are the physical embodiments and end results of the Onyx Amazons' great doctrine, the very same one which triggered their age-old exile to Saqaba: Through Woe And Ruin Alone Shalt Weakness Be Abolished - it is only through violence, hardship and suffering that one's flaws may and must be destroyed, it is only through ruthless torture and brutal denegation of the self that one will harden and become immune to the shortcomings of the flesh and mind alike. It is therefore no surprise that shaping these Onyx Colossi took such a tremendous sacrifice on Nabatem's part: in a terrifying gambit against the entire rest of the world, the Amazons had to profanate one of its most important sanctuaries to imbue their creation with its antediluvian energies; and while it could indeed appear at a first glance that by doing so the Necropolis' sorceresses forewent immense gifts in the form of resources and blessings, in truth it logically follows from their ideology that all they did was Destroy their own Weaknesses by sparing themselves and the entire world the possibility that someone else would claim these founts of magic and use them for much greater evils. In any case, their enemies now should tremble, for the Baetyl Titans, resonant in viscous thought, thread the world from now on, cloaked in unbearable might. Huorkhenti, Lord of Eclipses, is one of them and must be banished should the Dark God of Nabatem be stopped from ascending."

As a result, the engine would be able to overload up to once per year, obliterating its foes in truly atrocious ways. However, beware: the tapestry of the earth wouldn't be able to withstand the presence of several Engines in the same province, and breaking that fundamental law would certainly result in devastating hazards."

#descr "In times older than civilization, titanic Beasts of Divine might, intellect and nobility were tasked with protecting Nature. Also called the Ancients or the Primordials, they knew of the true names of things and were able to weave powerful magic with their every word. Many such Beasts used to exist and to guide mortals on the paths of wisdom and harmony. With time however, their influence inexorably declined, and most slowly departed for an unending slumber, the others falling one by one to war, madness, loneliness, hunters and heroes. Since then, though they lived on in legends, they were almost forgotten in all but one place: Pangaea. There, the younger races still revered them, awakening them in times of need. But in their absence, civilization prospered and mankind betrayed their trust. Without them to protect the forests of the world, Nature started to dwindle and suffered great pain. Then, something darker slowly began to stir. In the face of harm and sorrow, there was no other choice for the Wild than to release the wrath of the Vengeful Forest upon the world. Thus, with the Divine Beasts' failure, Asphodel had to be born. Soon, a terrible civil war might break out between the denizens of Pangaea and the Ancients tragically might rise against that which only wished to fulfill their abandoned mission. But there is at least one of them who shall then side with the Vengeful God. Meleanth the thirteenth Beast used to be a great black swan admired for his sad beauty. He was killed long ago, but now, with the wars of ascension dawning upon the world, like a rotting phoenix he has returned from Beyond and pledged loyalty to the Lord of Asphodel. Meleanth has the power to curse the land with his mere presence. Every month he both starts and ends in the same province without hiding, he will do so unless fortifications stop his influence. As a result, for a year and a day sickness will plague inhabitants and any temple or laboratory built there will decay and crumble."

Many such Divine Beasts used to exist and to guide mortals on the paths of wisdom and harmony. But one day, a terrible war broke out against a forgotten evil, and the Ancients were the first to stand against it and die. Much was lost in this conflict, but not all Ancients fell and although they no longer were numerous or powerful enough to fulfill their mission, a few still remained to try. With time however, old curses resurfaced and new ones were uttered. Knowing that their time was gone, most Primordials slowly departed for a millenia-long slumber, while others one by one fell to madness, loneliness, hunters and heroes. Now, although they still are remembered and revered as Guardians of the Forests by most cultures of the world, the Divine Beasts belong to the realm of legends. But there is one place where their legacy has been preserved and their sacred undertaking carried on: Pangaea. There, the younger races of centaurs, minotaurs, harpies and satyrs still follow their old teachings and rise in times of need to defend the wild. They now tend the Grove of Gaia in their place and from there know how to contact and awaken them should the absolute necessity emerge. Twelve of these ancient creatures have promised to heed the call of Pangaea if reached, and while Skiatatoskr is not truly one of them, as their messenger he shares much of their nature. He has always faithfully served their will in their absence and attended to their needs in their sleep. He is known as a divine trickster and some even claim that he secretly is the most powerful.

#descr "In times older than civilization, titanic Beasts of Divine might, intellect and nobility were tasked with protecting Nature. Also called the Ancients or the Primordials, they knew of the true names of things and were therefore able to weave powerful magic with every word of their sacred and forgotten tongue. Many such Divine Beasts used to exist and to guide mortals on the paths of wisdom and harmony. But one day, a terrible war broke out against a forgotten evil, and the Ancients were the first to stand against it and die. Much was lost in this conflict, but not all Ancients fell and although they no longer were numerous or powerful enough to fulfill their mission, a few still remained to try. With time however, old curses resurfaced and new ones were uttered. Knowing that their time was gone, most Primordials slowly departed for a millenia-long slumber, while others one by one fell to madness, loneliness, hunters and heroes. Now, although they still are remembered and revered as Guardians of the Forests by most cultures of the world, the Divine Beasts belong to the realm of legends. But there is one place where their legacy has been preserved and their sacred undertaking carried on: Pangaea. There, the younger races of centaurs, minotaurs, harpies and satyrs still follow their old teachings and rise in times of need to defend the wild. They now tend the Grove of Gaia in their place and from there know how to contact and awaken them should the absolute necessity emerge. Twelve of these ancient creatures have promised to heed the call of Pangaea if reached, and Malleorn the Wise Guardian Stag is one of them. Noble and patient of heart, he always was a benevolent teacher to mortals and a selfless protector to the weak. As such, he will enlighten a new Centaur Sage every month he spends researching and in battle will gift his allies with Mass Regeneration. Some also say that he bears the stars on his antlers, for the Light of the Northern Star always accompagnies him."

Many such Divine Beasts used to exist and to guide mortals on the paths of wisdom and harmony. But one day, a terrible war broke out against a forgotten evil, and the Ancients were the first to stand against it and die. Much was lost in this conflict, but not all Ancients fell and although they no longer were numerous or powerful enough to fulfill their mission, a few still remained to try. With time however, old curses resurfaced and new ones were uttered. Knowing that their time was gone, most Primordials slowly departed for a millenia-long slumber, while others one by one fell to madness, loneliness, hunters and heroes. Now, although they still are remembered and revered as Guardians of the Forests by most cultures of the world, the Divine Beasts belong to the realm of legends. But there is one place where their legacy has been preserved and their sacred undertaking carried on: Pangaea. There, the younger races of centaurs, minotaurs, harpies and satyrs still follow their old teachings and rise in times of need to defend the wild. They now tend the Grove of Gaia in their place and from there know how to contact and awaken them should the absolute necessity emerge. Twelve of these ancient creatures have promised to heed the call of Pangaea if reached, and Europous the Golden-Horned Bull is one of them. Stalwart guardian of the Thrones of Ascension, he was given horns and hooves of gold as weapons; but after the God took over, he yielded and recognized him as his master. In battle, he will bless his allies' armors with golden splendor, and if killed he will temporarily ascend as a new constellation and grant his beloved children with about thirty Astral pearls."

Rumored to be impossible to catch, he swiftly roams the coasts of the world. The winds are one with him and will always follow him in battle, granting their help to those he deems worthy."

Most numinous beings of absolute purity and self-accomplishment, it is said that they reached such perfection in both virtue and the arts that they utterly freed themselves from matter and ascended from Mount Cephalos' summit to become new living stars. As such, they are considered by philosophers to reside far above other deities, immediately below the God, both in terms of wisdom and of sheer power, which explains why they will only serve those who strive to attain excellency. The ultimate bearers of the Golden Age's ideals in the face of barbarity, the Astral Muses are also believed to be the inexhaustible sources of all divine inspiration as well as to be responsible for the beyond-human greatness of Arcoscephale's prophets. However, since they embody universal qualities, it is no surprise that many other cultures revere them as well and that any pretender god of sufficient might could convince them to become his own harbingers through the use of a Wish. For deep metaphysical and symbolic reasons, the Astral Muses are always associated with each other in groups of three called Triads. In each celestial Triad, there is one Muse who commands to the realms of the fickle and ethereal Air, one who rules over the peaceful flow of Waters, and one who is attuned to the blossoming grace of Nature. Outside of this, they share many wondrous talents, but the most powerful one may be their ability to spark brilliant thoughts in those who contemplate them and draw upon their gifts with enough discipline. As such, every province with at least one Astral Muse, five philosophers and a temple as a sanctum of thought and learning will become a great center of arcane knowledge and let Arcoscephale - and Arcoscephale only - benefit from a steady income of Astral pearls - on average five every other month."

As such, every province with at least one Astral Muse, five philosophers and a temple as a sanctum of thought and learning will become a great center of arcane knowledge and let Arcoscephale - and Arcoscephale only - benefit from a steady income of Astral pearls - on average five every other month."

The pinnacle of the art of crystal-forging, it is believed to have been first created in an effort to emulate the antediluvian magic of the Crystal Ark. The crystal golem is physically strong, immensely tough, and skilled in Earth and Astral magic. Like regular golems, it will never retreat from battle. It is made entirely of singing crystal, and more powerful where magic permeates the lands."

#name "Exsanguine Guide"
#descr "An Exsanguine Guide is a dying Enarie who decided - or was forced - to extract from his own body the energies of vitality and to convert them into magical essence. As a result of doing so, the Exsanguine Guide the wondrous ability to generate three gems of Nature per month in the form of mystical elixirs; however, it is only by preserving his own existence through necromantic rituals that he avoided immediate death, and his now undead remains can only be kept functional for a few months before they collapse and his soul must depart to the Underworld. If the Exsanguine Guide avoids combat, he will live for eight months before dying, but his advanced state of decomposition makes him entirely unable to travel long distance and leave his current province without magical means."

#descr "When the Witch Kings of Sauromatia infuse Dark Vines with the cruel blessing of the Sacred Swamp, they give them sacred status and the dread-inspiring name of Unholy Vines. Like dark vines, unholy vines are huge, writhing masses of roots, vines and blood-drenched moss that form a trunk with three tentacles at the top. They are driven by an insatiable lust for blood, but serve their master unerringly. Unholy vines are immensely robust and cannot rout from combat."

Rivals of the Augurs, they never were as popular as them in Ermor, and their order fell out of favor long ago before the emperor and the church. But now, with the True God nearing his awakening, they may return and find a new place in the empire under one of the Decrees. All Diviners are skilled in Water magic, but depending on their origins they can also master one or several other magic paths."

#descr "Seekers of Destinies are ancient Ermorian Augur Elders who have forsaken their order or been forced to exile by their peers. These erudite parias and enigmatic wanderers are aware of the grim future that their actions brought and now hide in hope of one day atoning for their crimes. Although they are still lost and looking for a truth worth living for, they are ready to serve the Awakening One with humility, and, having entirely abandoned the magics of Death and Fire as well as their selfish ambitions even before the fateful proclamation of an Imperial Decree by the God, their survival and their help may very well be tolerated by the reformed Ermorian church. Although Seekers of Destinies do not require any payment or upkeep for their services and at a first glance may appear to be very weak, they actually hold immense mystical secrets, some of which were believed to be irrevocably lost until their resurgence. This allows them to cast spells with incredible ease, and as a result they will start every battle with a power equivalent to that of three temporary Astral pearls."

#name "Zurvan"
#descr "The Zurvan is a mysterious spirit of space and time which is said to share the nature of both the Daevas and the Yazatas. A living metaphysical bridge between the two polar opposites of Caelian dualism, it has always kept an absolute neutrality in their celestial wars and is worshipped by some unorthodox sects who believe that neither the Destructive Spirit nor the Lord of Wisdom should be considered the enemy. Although as an everpresent being it can fold and unfold dimensions, which allows it to cast battle spells twice as quickly as most other mages and to travel by Will and the Laws of Simultaneity, its physical manifestation is bound to the place of its summoning and will quickly fade away if ordered to take too active of a part in the destinies of mortals. The Zurvan is also highly attuned to magic and under the right scales will both access greater knowledge and greater arcane might from the Celestial Archives. Since it is of a completely ethereal nature, it is inefficient at the tasks of forging items or more generally interacting with material reality, however in the spiritual domain it is extremely powerful and with very minor adjustments can perform even the highest rituals of Caelian lore."

Whenever a young Abysian shows particular ability to control the sacred element, intuition of its hidden ways or mental aptitude in general, most of the time the Salamanders will take him with them and raise him as a Newt. Although promising individuals sometimes prove to be ambitious and show enthousiasm at the idea of learning and following the path to Power, there are others who are not willing at all, but this is not a matter of any importance in the Hunt for new blood, and if necessary the Anathemants will even send assassins to capture by force those who show too much reluctance to join them - they will thank them eventually."

Although unlike Carrion Lords they are not sacred to Asphodel and do not bear any priestly authority, they are magically even more powerful than them and possess several very dangerous other abilities, such as those to entangle anyone that touches them, to bewitch closeby enemies with supernatural sleep, to regenerate very rapidly in combat and to spend the month creating a lesser Mandragora for free. They raise as temporary, lesser Mandragoras anyone that they kill in combat and, like liches, they are truly immortal for in time their body will inescapably regrow from their slain remains."

#copyspr 2213 -- Gore Tide Horror
#name "Uboath"
#descr "The Uboath is an abominable entity created by the Aboleths to trap and eradicate intruders. Mistakenly believing that the Aboleths are only masters of deception and vulnerable in direct confrontation, mortals that encounter Uboaths are very unlikely to be prepared to such a destructive and resilient weapon. Uboaths are artificial golems made out of a strange, dark liquid substance that is always cold to the touch. Albeit similar to Water elementals in their basic concept, they have been enchanted with extremely ancient and powerful magic which gift them with otherworldly qualities and cause some scholars to suspect that they might be related to Gore Tide Horrors. These mindless entities obey their masters' cryptic instructions to the letter and are often ordered to guard that which is the most important to the Elder Race's current goals; as such, they have sacred status, even though their unholy nature causes intense disgust and horror in the hearts or mortals. Unlike Water elementals, Uboaths do not shrink when hurt and are very hard to destroy thanks to their highly efficient regenerative properties; their slime is both sticky and glacial, which makes them very hard to escape, but they also have a dramatic weakness to Fire, a fact that very few would suspect at a first glance."

#name "Veiled Master"
#descr "Veiled Masters are the most powerful and authoritative terrestrial agents of the Elder Race. Each of these elite Androdai hosts the consciousness, will and magic of a Mind Lord, who then uses this vessel like a second skin as an expendable but properly powerful avatar to plot and design the demise of mortal nations from afar. Abnormally resilient as the receptacles of the Aboleths' vast intellect when compared to the regular Androdai, Veiled Masters offer perfect control to their puppeteers and consequently are grand masters of deception as well as of the magic of illusion. As such, they are diabolically efficient as infiltrators, often taking the shape of high-ranking foreign leaders they murdered or mind-controlled to secretly replace them, freely sow corruption and discord in the young realms and eventually precipitate their fall. Even though they are nearly undetectable through traditional means, should one of them ever be unmasked, he still would be a formidable opponent thanks to his various magical abilities, some of which must however be unlocked through special items such as the disturbing Mind Worms; but even when killed, Veiled Masters are easily replaced, giving off to their hunters the frightening impression that they are in fact immortal, which isn't very far from the truth, since a single, intemporal mind - that of its Aboleth lord - is shared between all of a given Veiled Master's successive incarnations. Still, thanks to their vast array of rare skills, it frequently happens as well that Veiled Masters are used not as expatriate impostors but as official representatives of the Mind Lords and as the magical spearhead of their terrestrial armies. The main reason for that fact is that they are the only beings in existence, besides Aboleths themselves, with the arcane knowledge required to use Aphotic Orbs. Such a great power however comes at a certain cost, and to become a Veiled Master requires the sacrifice of a few of the Androdai's own abilities."

Designed by the Physicist Scholar geniuses based on a stratagem that was originally devised against them by Arcoscephale, this powerful weapon is lightly enchanted so that it can move without external help and crush the Basilei's foes under its heavy wheels of hardened wood; but the most important of the Great Horse of Dardanum's strengths comes from the fact that it is almost completely hollow, allowing it to shelter betwixt its mechanisms the bodies, supplies and full equipment of about twenty trained warriors. Thus, this number of elite myrmidons will exit the Great Horse's belly at the start of every battle and fight by its side for the greatest glory of Triliax. Being fully reloaded in troops and furniture after every battle, although it is slow, vulnerable to fire and entirely unable to go underwater, this war machine truly is one of the most efficient trump cards of the nation."

#name "Anointed of Fire"
#descr "The first Abysians sprung from the Fires of Rhuax were large magmatic beings, barely resembling humans at all. Slowly these monstrosities developed into humanoids. With every generation, the Fires of Rhuax grew cooler in their bodies and the flaming Children of Rhuax became smoldering Abysians. Abysians of prominent heritage are larger and surrounded by flames. They are called Burning Ones and are sacred to the degenerates. These Anointed Ones always led the enigmatic people of Abysia, and as such they also are held responsible for the birth of the Garnet Amazons. For centuries, they have been separated from their creations, but now, with Zun's quick rise in power, the High Vestals have started to take an interest in their hated progenitors. Some of them have even designed plans to reverse the roles of old and through summoning magic enslave their former masters with delightful irony. The Anointed Ones are no fools, and once they're trapped by the Amazons, they know that they must cooperate or die, if not worse. Thus, an agreement between the Vestals and them is reached most of the time; they are allowed to bear the Mask of Purpose, but in exchange their powerful magic must serve the Triumph of Femininity. Although they lose their sacred status when being abducted, Anointed Ones still are very powerful mages, and the Amazons know it. They are great masters of fire, blood and earth magic, and as the pure children of flames, they start every battle with three temporary gems of fire."

#descr "A secret of the Garnet Amazons' magical arts and an alchemical creation of great power, a Blood Vessel is a supernatural body entirely made of living blood and the ultimate conclusion of the Vestals' research in magical cloning. It is said that its legendary inventor, the ancient sorceress Baghal-Syr, still has many of these entities hidden all across the world as clones and safeguards for her own death. Requiring the gruesome sacrifice of many for its shaping, a Blood Vessel is useless until the blood and soul of either an exceptionally powerful being or the mage herself is added to the mixture, which implies her own violent death as well. Starting from this moment, the morbid elixir is animated with the lifeforce and will of the chosen being and acts as an almost indestructible Vessel for her spirit. This horrendous fluid can take many forms but usually has the shape of a female being of great beauty, and since to the Zunnites it represents the purest form an ascended being can take, it is considered both sacred and female, regardless of its origins; in addition, since it is a clearly living entity, it cannot be considered undead and rather shares its qualities with magical beings. Like a nectar of immortality, it is perpetually self-rejuvenating, and its repugnant tendrils are able to suck the lifeforce out of its victims, making of the Blood Vessel a formidable and very dangerous foe. It doesn't need any kind of sustenance and as such can survive without food or air for very long periods of time."

Obsessed with power, control and immortality as much as with the task of finding a final solution to her people's dependency upon Blood magic, she constructed many hidden facilities all around the world, and there, she made very advanced research into ways to free oneself from her own body. In the end, she discovered the ritual of Blood Vessel creation, but then, she suddenly disappeared, and what actually happened back then remained a mystery to the world until now. In truth, she had also achieved the old dream of the Abysians: she had found a way to create life from nothingness, and as such, to make the use of Blood magic completely free. Unable to reveal her newfound secret to the Amazons while the Pantokrator was still there and risked to punish her and her people with a thousand dooms, she calculatingly decided to move on to the next phase of her plan by ensuring that it would never be possible to destroy her or her secret. Thus, in complete secrecy, she started creating innumerable clones of herself as a safeguard against death, so that her knowledge, key to the redemption of a whole race, could never be lost, and although adventurers, pillagers or mystery seekers occasionally explored some of her facilities and very rarely escaped alive, thus bringing to the world the rumor of her mad cloning, her true goals never were revealed. But now, with the Pantokrator gone and Zun on the verge of eternal glory or extinction, the time has come for Baghal-Syr to come back and change the destiny of her people forever."

Cursed a very long time ago by a divine edict preventing them from leaving the region of Zun, the five Bastard-Princesses are responsible for its desertic state and, thus roaming it since even before the Amazons' arrival, they have always been an important part of the Zunnite legends. For centuries, through seduction, manipulation and violence, they have tried to convince the Vestals of releasing them. Now at last, the Amazons have sealed a pact with Allatu and, with her greatest desire fulfilled, she will serve the Awakening God with all her strength."

While somewhat inferior to the original design, they are still formidable living statues of bronze."

Even though their sustenance and substance are both spiritual in nature, they are completely mindless even when compared to animals and they cannot comprehend anything other than pure emotion, which paradoxically doesn't prevent them from having or perhaps even being abstract and usually pretty random feelings. When Thalamanth's Cloud Sages awaken their passion for freedom and beauty in the right way, they take the form of ethereal birds and strike with living thunder all that is earthly and low. They don't care about any kind of justice or logic and need no reason to behave as they do. They simply follow the flow of pure aesthetics such as they see it and are intensely unpredictable for anyone who doesn't know how to dance with them metaphorically and please them with keen turns of phrase. They are unaffected by storms, and when the element of air is unchained around them, their power increases."

#name "Mist Avatar"
#descr "Mist Avatars are incredibly powerful air elementals, living tempests that take the vague shape of a giant eagle. While all of them were born Titan-Eagles, they chose to make the noble sacrifice of their flesh in order to serve Thalamanth with unbound magical power and rage. Now that their body is composed of billowing clouds and mist, they are entirely unable to enter water even with the aid of magic, however they also are extraordinarily difficult to harm, especially since their self-reforming and nearly immaterial essence is protected from cold and fire alike by their newly gained powers over celestial waters. In addition, just like Titan-Eagles, they continuously create new air elementals during battle, and they do so with even greater efficiency."

They are also called Eosphorides because the star Eosphoros announces their coming alongside that of the zephyr. Elder sisters of the Aurae, they are so light and unearthly that even the wind is less immaterial and immaculate than they are. Each Aurorae is the personification of one of the rays of the rising sun that warms sleeping hearts and bodies, and each scatters healing dew behind her steps. It is said that their fingers are soft and pink like rose petals, and that a simple touch from them is enough to rapture the heart of any mortal. Their only attire is composed of an iridescent veil that doesn't hide at all their blissful nudity. They are radiant vessels of the God's Awakening's splendor and have great priestly powers, and each of them attracts one of their younger sisters bearing a solar gem of Fire each month, as if the Aurae were inexorably enamoured of them."

#descr "Unlike other Cyclopes, Cyclops Kings are very clever and do not come from simple mountains. Instead, they are born from the heart of volcanoes, and they are the purest of all Cyclops kin, which makes them priest-kings among Cyclopes. They know that their single eye is symbolic of the volcanic crater which birthed them, and this is the source of their great power over earth, fire and blood. Like their ancestors who served the Titans before being imprisoned by the Pantokrator or joining Mekone, they are mage-smiths of exceptional talent. They are half-divine beings, and in a great ritual sacrifice they can blind themselves to replace their single eye with a swirling and bubbling Blood Crater, which will greatly improve their magical skills, especially in crossbreeding."

It takes the form of a gigantic jellyfish of glaucous colors, but is very rarely seen directly for its dark and translucent silhouette is usually indistinguishable from the turbulent tides of foam and algae that course around it. Its thousands of thin tentacles burn everything they touch with acidic toxins and surround its body like a ghostly veil at all times. Charybdis is the embodiment of murderous tempest and a huge whirlpool announces its coming. It also has a sister called Scylla - the Demi-Goddess of abyssal monsters and aqueous wrath. Scylla's physical form is not that of a single body, but the ten thousand-headed mass of draconic sea serpents that accompanies Charybdis like its shadow. Charybdis and Scylla are inseparable and together they bear incredible magical powers. Both are sacred to Triliax and many great kings have been forced by oracles to sacrifice their most precious belongings to their all-consuming maws. They can't leave the water under any circumstance."

#descr "Sky Trees are very ancient and wise sentient trees of unsettling immaculate foliage that always were enamoured of birdkind and served as their secret benevolent shelters or even as living strongholds. While they are still extremely resilient, they are noticeably more fragile than other sentient trees such as the legendary Treelords, and they are also less earthly than them, more interested in the sky than in plants and nature as a whole. Incidentally, it is said that they developed a tight friendship with the clouds, which would explain their misty appearance. In any case, although they are magically extremely powerful and sacred to all birds, they aren't the leaders of Nephelococcygia and only serve as the spiritual guides of a few species, the Ancient Owls more than any other, cherishing the other birds' freedom and spontaneity as their most beautiful trait. Still, since the Ancient Owls are among the leaders of Nephelococcygia, the Sky Trees are revered by the Republic in the Clouds as a holy crest and rallying symbol, and their advice is treasured as unmistakable truth; therefore, hundreds of birds will gladly sacrifice themselves if necessary to ensure their survival. Along with the City in the Sky itself, which they helped build with their great magic, they are the personified backbone of the Nation of the Birds and it certainly won't break before they do."

#descr "Primordial Eagles are the most holy guardians of Nephelococcygia. They are only known from ancient legends, but Nephelococcygia's daring plan to steal divinity from the gods and reach supreme power nonetheless relies on their return. They are said to be direct manifestations of the Sun and to bear in their heart the very essence of all birdkind. They are the ancestors of all Solar Birds and it is suspected that this holds true for lesser golden birds as well. Giant and terrifying monsters from an earlier and almost forgotten era when the gods treaded the earth, they hold immense physical, magical and priestly powers and are the most perfect form a bird can take. They share all abilities of the Solar Birds, and in addition are extremely charismatic leaders that summon two Solar Bird combatants per month, spread dominion and have a great control over fire, air and the stars. They are almost impossible to harm without magical weapons, and as the greatest heralds of the sacred light of the City in the Sky, they allow for the recruitment and summoning of Birds of Glory, very efficient preachers which will also continuously come to their aid in battle. They truly are divine beings and once they roam again the earth and the skies, the enemies of Nephelococcygia shall tremble with very good reason."

Unlike other kinds of golden bird, they must acquire their status rather than be born with it, and therefore they don't exist at all in nature but are the direct product of Nephelococcygia's efforts to steal divinity from the gods. As such, they are living embodiments of the Cloud Republic's aspirations and they are able to directly drain the faith of mortals before it can reach heaven. They shine like the sun and anyone daring to strike them risks losing their eyes forever. A Primordial Eagle must have been brought back to the world in order to recruit them, and Primordial Eagles are also able to summon them. Like Solar Birds, Birds of Glory also require half the upkeep they normally would."

Not only are they very powerful mages of blood and death, they are also extraordinarily cunning and devious bringers of misfortune and plague that can weave the demise of their enemies while staying hidden in the shadows. In addition, only they are able to forge the horrible Wyrd Masks that are key to the schemes of the Wyrd Masters' covens. Truly, they are a frightening weapon to behold and no other ally of Nephelococcygia can offer such peculiar abilities as theirs."

#descr "Thunderer Birds, or Fulminans, are peculiar metallic birds whose feathers of gold were enchanted and replaced with a supernatural kind of electrum easily recognizable by its bright blue crackling glow. Although they were mere animals before their metamorphosis, they were remade into entirely supernatural beings. As a result, even though they are now physically a lot less nimble and resilient than other birds of their size, they are deeply attuned to the power of storms and can strike their foes with violent thundercracks. While this powerful attack can be used from a long range and may strike several soldiers at once, it is very imprecise and can hurt allies as well, so it is best used with effects that enhance precision. Since Thunderer Birds were golden birds before their transformation, they retained both their sacred status and their near immunity to the elements."

For this reason, the marvels of architecture and sculpture known to the sages of Isphenople due to their arcoscephalian and C'tissian origins have always been used to magically help guard the Citadel and have constantly improved with time. Nowadays, Isphenople's watchers are more often enchanted statues than living beings. Although they can only be built in a Wondrous Workshop and with the great expertise of an Engineer, they don't cost any gold, even for upkeep, and they can be summoned as well. In the near future, being almost indestructible and indefatigable combatants, they probably will be instrumental to the Conclave's plans for territorial expansion. Still, they can only be repaired in laboratories and can be lead in combat only by commanders that have some magic knowledge, such as High Bookkeepers and other statuary commanders."

Even their horns and jaws are enchanted with destructive magic, making them extraordinarily fearsome combatants. Their greatest flaw may be their lack of hands, which renders them unable to use forged weapons and shields. In addition, like all magical statues, they require a laboratory to be repaired."

#descr "For centuries, the secret Gnostic Order has worshipped the Dazzling Darkness of an abstract God of pure, unfathomable thought. Although this Divine Mystery is entirely antithetical to the impurity of matter, it is a Pleroma composed of several strata, or Aeons, and one of its lowest hypostases, the inflexible Sophia, is able to incarnate within a sacred Vessel built with enough care and complex magic.

Although only one Unutterable Vessel can exist at a time, it can be rebuilt any number of times by recasting the ritual that created it in the first place. Still, when destroyed it loses all its magical powers and artifacts, and therefore all five Unutterable Knowledge rituals must be cast again. Sophia the Unutterable One, Messenger of Inevitability, the Bringer of Gnosis and Silence, Blind Spirit within the Vault, is the shadow of Isphenople's Pretender God and must be banished to prevent the Conclave's ascension and its unveiling of the Ultimate Secret."

They are extraordinarily powerful mages of nature and air, and they have the ability to spend a month summoning three seasonal spirits.

#descr "A Baetyl Daemon is a Baetyl Eidolon that disproportionately grew in power due to the repeated worship it received. Baetyl Daemons are neither demons nor inherently malevolent, but deep, disincarnate intellects of immense pride and self-importance that strongly believe in their own divinity. As such, and due to their great power and immortality, even though they are of a neutral nature rather than essentially good or evil beings, they are extremely easy to offend and anger, and their very uncommon abilities make it incredibly hard to defend oneself against them. Like all Baetyl Eidolons, they are ethereal and perfectly invisible; but Daemons also are far more clever and manipulative and can be used as extraordinarily patient and stealthy assassins. However, their greatest and most dreadful power is by far the dark and sickening influence they have on their surroundings. Their presence is often enough to make nature dwindle in an entire province, due to their immense hunger for life force and their ability to drain it directly through supernatural means. In addition, since they hate the stone in which they were enclosed, they'll automatically destroy Baetyl Obelisks and Pits of Living Shadows in the province in which they are located, even if said province is owned by the enemy, and unless an Onyx Priestess is there to give it sacred protection."

Once the Rephaim all lived in Hinnom, but when the kingdom of Apsum was founded, it was influenced by Rephaites and began to worship the Rephaite kings as gods, attracting some of them to live here in power and luxury. Now, with the coming of the Awakening God and the sealing of a new Pact, these idolatrous and unholy practices are coming to an end, but not all Melqarts will simply leave their kingdom, and some will become apostates to the very faith that worshipped them so that they become accepted in Nabatem and serve their fathers' Lost Necropolis. The Melqarts are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught all kinds of secrets by their fathers and are born with magical powers. They are descendants of Azazel and share his gifts. The Melqarts have gruesome appetites and feast on the flesh of men. Unlike those of Berytos and Hinnom, the Melqarts of Apsum no longer are sacred or have any priestly authority."

It is only recently that Abysian mages have discovered a gorge near the borders of the old kingdom, where ancient magic has been uncovered by eroding winds and a mighty earthquake. Huge bones were found protruding from the very stone. Legends of long forgotten glorious victories against the blessed giants were remembered and soon the Abysian mages were trying to awaken the fossilized giants once defeated by fire in the valley of Megiddo. Fossilized giants are as hard as stone, but somewhat brittle. Ancient bronze armor has partially merged with their darkened bones."

#name "Ancient Tumulus"
#descr "A Tumulus is the great tomb of a long-forgotten king, druid or shaman buried underneath a large mound, and as such is also a deep entrance to the korrigan kingdoms and the Underworld. With the Geodetic Awakening, Tumuli are gradually opening their massive doors and unveiling the obscure chambers they were designed to protect, thus monthly generating about twenty gold each up to once per province; but in no way does this mean that they are becoming harmless. On the contrary, along with treasures of gilded bronze and jewelry, what intruders would likely find Below is their death at the hands of hordes of spirits, undead creatures and dark magic surging out of the black mouth of the earth. Since they cannot move in any way - even through teleportation rituals -, Ancient Tumuli can be considered defensive structures that guard Karanaac's holy ground against any and all profaners. But in spite of that weakness, they are very powerful indeed, due to their ability to continually cast spells for as long as intruders are present, as well as to the three temporary death gems they can use each battle. In addition, one corpse candle will appear to guard its Tumulus every month, and the Tumulus will allow its master to use a small part of its precious gold for his own glory."

#name "Ageless Cromlech"
#descr "A Cromlech is to a dolmen what a dolmen is to a menhir: an assembly of megaliths of lower complexity whose union gives birth to a new and more powerful emergent consciousness. As such, Cromlechs are great stone circles of almost perfect shape, commonly used by druids as astronomical clocks, in which several dolmens enter a 'communion of communions'. Like dolmens, and even more so, their vast wisdom and enlarged sentience allow them to be extraordinarily good leaders, and in addition they have great ritual powers over nature and the stars. But what truly distinguishes them from other megaliths is their unique ability to cast the Gateway, Astral Travel and Telluric Convergence rituals - a feat that no other truly immobile being is capable of. Thus, Ageless Cromlechs are commonly used by the Geodetic Awakening to instantaneously teleport whole communion arrays of menhirs and singing stones in sudden megalithic attacks of huge scope that should be able to get rid of all living opposition in the targeted province."

#descr "Korrigan Elders are korrigans of great age, intelligence and magical power. Like their cousins the gnomes, they live underneath the earth and, as faeries, know how to weave illusions or curse their opponents with a single touch. And while their more popular relatives are diurnal guardians of nature, mountains and the lands of the living, Korrigan Elders are defenders of the dark and of entrances to the Underworld. They protect the barren stone fields of Karanaac by haunting intruders and by preventing them from ever coming back to tell what they saw. Like lesser korrigans, they have an ambivalent position in the Geodetic Awakening, for they both are mobile and need to stay close to their homes. But they also are wise enough to command korrigans and other magical beings into battle, and like gnomes, they are mages of respectable power, although they usually master death rather than nature magic. In addition, they are cunning sorcerers who know how to use luck and misfortune to their advantage and as such they keep weird talismans with them at all times to protect themselves and pierce the magical defenses of their foes. Unlike megaliths, Korrigan Elders are living beings that can regenerate their wounds and cost upkeep."

#name "Korrigan"
#descr "Korrigans are dark faeries that live underneath the earth and guard the Underworld. They are strongly associated with megaliths, as it is said that their homes are located right below menhirs, and that they themselves turn to stone during the day, thus temporarily becoming singing stones. Although korrigans aren't inherently evil like demons, they are very well known for their great cruelty, which isn't always immediately obvious due to their child-like appearance and their great love of jokes - but their jokes can quickly become mortal, and under no circumstance do they tolerate breaking one's word after one of their games has started, which can lead to terrifying or tragical situations. While korrigans are almost as physically weak as hoburgs - to which they may be somehow distantly related -, they still are very dangerous opponents, especially in great numbers, due to their natural ability to weave illusions to defend themselves, the vicious rage that is theirs when hurt, and the dark spells that protect them and curse their murderers. But a great weakness offsets their strengths, for even though they can be found in every megalithic alignment, they cannot leave them for long without slowly dying out or turning to stone. Thus, in spite of their mobility - precious and rare for Karanaac's defenders -, in times of war they are mostly used as defenders or in quick raids. Unlike megaliths, Korrigans are living beings that can regenerate their wounds and cost upkeep."

Thus, by magnifying blemmye language in an unbearable symphony of trumpets, organs, bird songs, flatulences, squeaks, barks and other unexpected dissonances from hell, they spread the inhumane designs of Mu everywhere they go, and with this powerful Call of Delirium warp reality and the mind alike in an uncontrollable tempest of utterly random events previously thought of as impossibilities."

#descr "Autoktonioi, Self-Borns of the Earth and Master Dancers of the Palm and the Foot, are semi-divine blemmyes spawned directly from the Navel of U as messengers of the God in times of great need. They resemble giant sciapods but have twice the number of limbs - two legs and four arms -, and their skin and flesh, tougher and rougher than other blemmyes', seem to be made of clay. These legendary warriors are the most sacred and heroic in U and, should they be killed, their perfect body would eventually reform itself from the soil, in the same way as it was born in the first place. Since they dedicate their whole life to the mystical arts of dance and war, they are solitary by nature and only speak when necessary, never deviating from their holy mission; but they still are among the most intelligent of all blemmyes and they are well known in U for having taught the Priests of the Palm and the Dancers of the Foot their sacred disciplines in the ancient times, which also makes them responsible, along with the Mu-Atlaï, for uplifting the sciapods and allowing them to build a semblance of order and culture. As one of the rare kinds of sentient blemmyes that do not descend from protozoons, they are speculated to be the result of some form of resurgence of the original blemmyes, the mythical Androgynes that disappeared eons ego, with which they share a few defining characteristics; and although they aren't as pure as the Androgynes were, they still are the closest a blemmye could come to perfection without reshaping this flawed world. Although their peculiar fighting style forbids them the use of armors, Autoktonioi are protected by their naturally hard skin, and they master the foot and the fist with such expertise that even alone and unarmed they are at a great advantage against small human armies. In addition, like sciapod Athletes and Champions and for the same reasons, they are stronger in lands of Production and weaker in lands of Sloth."

#descr "Unnatural entities of unspeakable weirdness, Surreal Aberrations are the first heralds of Mu, and their mere presence brings to reality the realms of imagination and insanity, dismantling logic and self-consistency as in a dream within a dream. These inconceivable monstrosities take the shape of giant spiders entirely made out of disproportionately long human legs joined by a headless human torso that pulses with visions of horror. Their nightmarish appearance is furthermore aggravated by their inhuman mobility, as they move with seemingly unequalled speed, in addition to being able to climb walls and ceilings with perfect ease. Unstoppable creepers that hide in darkness to spread madness in foreign lands or ambush key leaders of the enemy, these unholy creatures are able to destroy reason with a mere touch, feedbleminding their foes if not outright killing them. They are also sometimes sighted in blemmye territory, where they appear to tend to the supposedly pure, inoffensive and purposeless Angel Eggs - an unnerving hint towards their importance in some unknown, abominable design. While unintelligent, relatively fragile and less skilled than most assassins, Surreal Aberrations still are formidable opponents and should rightfully be feared as the first signs of the impending reshaping of the world at the hands of cyclopean wrights beyond mortal understanding."

Thanks to their powerful jaw, they can spit that substance at greater distances than regular Cave Cows, and since they also have three additional stomachs, they are able to do so for a longer duration before they run out of saliva. They produce a strange, slimy, translucent milk which is often consumed by sciapods both in times of peace when dwelving in sterile caves and in times of war when pillaging barren lands.

#name "Thinking Protozoon"
#descr "Unlike other protozoons, Thinking Protozoons, as their name suggests, are sentient. While at first they could look like bodyless heads with additional organs such as a stomach, instead scholars generally believe that they are limbless bellies with a face. Indeed, following the theory according to which non-protozoon blemmyes are born from the jointing of several protozoons - one per bodypart -, this would explain from where their faces and torsos come from. In any case, lacking any way to move or even feed themselves, these huge balls of fat and brains are almost completely powerless alone, especially since they are extremely gluttonous and lazy. In spite of these great flaws, sciapods have found a very important use for them: thinking in their place. After all, thinking is a painful activity for most sciapods, and while this is also the case of thinking protozoons, they cannot make themselves useful in any other way and are completely unable to defend themselves against bullying. Thus, while their complete dependency upon sciapods for their survival means that they'll always obey them and do their hard mental work for them, they still will be much more efficient in this task if their masters do not allow them to slack off, which explains why Production scales increase their research abilities and why Sloth scales diminish them, making them the polar opposite of Arcoscephalean philosophers. In spite of this, they remain an important weapon of U even under Sloth scales, especially since along with Eye Tyrants they are the only blemmyes capable of making use of crowns, and in particular Ioun Stones. In addition, thinking protozoons can serve in battle as mediocre Earth mages, but they remain extremely inefficient at casting rituals or forging magical items."

#name "Protozoic Amalgamation"
#descr "Among the most repugnant and unnatural of all blemmyes and no more than the anomalous byproduct of some unknown process gone awfully wrong, Protozoic Amalgamations are monstrous aggregates of flesh and bone that never cease to seek more organic matter to absorb. These enormous outgrowths of creeping meat are so abominable to the world, so odious to the gods and so aberrant in the extreme heterogeneity of their components that, truly impossible to define, they combine all natures and all creature types in a single being. As such, although they also belong to all of the opposite classes, they are considered to be simultaneously mindless, undead, demonic, magical, animal, coldblooded and inanimate - which also explains why even the Mu-Atlaï abhor them and cannot bless them. Devouring every living thing they touch like an unstoppable tide of disparate arms, legs and mouths, these distorted entities are among the most frightening and destructive weapons of U, even though they also are very difficult to control and fail to distinguish between humans and blemmyes when looking for more to eat."

#name "Sophotatos"
#descr "It is a well-known fact that blemmyes are extremely unskilled at magic. Resulting from their generally low intelligence, primitive knowledge, cult of strength and near-inability to pronounce consonants, that heavy handicap would have most likely made them an easy prey for more advanced civilizations if it wasn't for the exceptional stubbornness of Sophotatoi. Creditable for having prevented the conquest and fall of U on numerous occasions, Sophotatoi, also called Hypersages, are incredibly obstinate sciapods who focused all the efforts of their whole lifetime on learning as much as they could about a specific mystical subject and relentlessly trained on its exclusive mastery. These very lonely creatures are the closest thing there is to a savant or an erudite in U, but they are so over-specialized that, besides their eventual priestly powers, they only know about a single, very restrictive matter, usually a spell which they master so perfectly that they can cast it at will, without any cost. Although they are highly respected by all sciapods, they also live apart from society, for they do not have any interest in social pursuits; and if it wasn't for that heavily obsessive and asocial behavior, they would most likely have positions of power as shamans in their tribes. Still, it is not rare for a sciapod tribe to seek out the wisdom of a local Sophotatos when confronted with unmanageable problems, the supernatural or more generally the unknown; as if that local Hypersage finds his one-sided power helpless in that situation, he should at least be able to direct that tribe towards another of his brothers, possibly living very far away, but undoubtedly owning the exact, perfect solution to that very specific issue.
This specific Sophotatos is learned in the thaumaturgical arts of detecting sources of power and magical sites. He is completely unable to cast rituals or forge items, and in battle, his spells will always be completely random."

Although they are highly respected by all sciapods, they also live apart from society, for they do not have any interest in social pursuits; and if it wasn't for that heavily obsessive and asocial behavior, they would most likely have positions of power as shamans in their tribes. Still, it is not rare for a sciapod tribe to seek out the wisdom of a local Sophotatos when confronted with unmanageable problems, the supernatural or more generally the unknown; as if that local Hypersage finds his one-sided power helpless in that situation, he should at least be able to direct that tribe towards another of his brothers, possibly living very far away, but undoubtedly owning the exact, perfect solution to that very specific issue.
This specific Sophotatos worships monoliths and the absolute weight of the mountain; gifted with the holy power to make everything heavier and immobile, he automatically casts Curse of Stones at the start of every battle."

Still, it is not rare for a sciapod tribe to seek out the wisdom of a local Sophotatos when confronted with unmanageable problems, the supernatural or more generally the unknown; as if that local Hypersage finds his one-sided power helpless in that situation, he should at least be able to direct that tribe towards another of his brothers, possibly living very far away, but undoubtedly owning the exact, perfect solution to that very specific issue.
This specific Sophotatos has always studied the holy word of Mu and became an expert in theologal anatomy. He is an inquisitor and an elegist, and as a prophet exchanges his mastery of Earth for tremendous priestly powers."

This specific Sophotatos is of one of the least specialized kinds in all of U. He is a regular albeit weak mage of Nature as well as a priest and a scout. While he isn't restricted to a single spell, he is unskilled at research and item forging."

Too monstrous to be called humanoid and too unnatural to be the result of random chance, their anatomy gives an incredibly uncanny feeling to most observers; and so does their intelligence, for it is obviously too alien to allow communication with humans or thought on the same level as them, and for they still cleverly serve their ominous purpose with disturbing efficiency. Although many others could be found in the twisted nightmares of Mu, the most common of these properly inhuman creatures are the gruesome Terminae, each of which takes the shape of a single giant eye on top of two disproportionately long human legs. The unnerving fact that they apparently never were sighted until about a decade ago causes some scholars to doubt they even existed before then and shrouds their entire being in mystery; but with the recent and unexplainable multiplication of testimonies about them near the lands of U, it must now be accepted that such aberrations are truly real. Apparently created by the Awakening God of U as unholy harbingers of madness, it is speculated that they are shaped from the flesh of exceptional Sophotatoi who were thus rewarded for their skills, and that, as the bearers of highly improved supernatural abilities, they are intended to eventually entirely replace the primitive Hypersages; but the truth remains unknown, as sciapods deny this strongly, instead seeing the towering Terminae as forgotten guardians whose resurgence is an omen of victory, ancient servants of even more powerful beings, the nearly divine Mu-Atlaï.

Apparently created by the Awakening God of U as unholy harbingers of madness, it is speculated that they are shaped from the flesh of exceptional Sophotatoi who were thus rewarded for their skills, and that, as the bearers of highly improved supernatural abilities, they are intended to eventually entirely replace the primitive Hypersages; but the truth remains unknown, as sciapods deny this strongly, instead seeing the towering Terminae as forgotten guardians whose resurgence is an omen of victory, ancient servants of even more powerful beings, the nearly divine Mu-Atlaï.
This specific Termina focuses its powers in destroying the lucidity of mortals with hallucinations. It automatically casts Confusion twice per turn and summons a False Horror at the start of every battle."

#descr "In times so ancient that they predated even the Titans, the Mu-Atlaï were seven primordial giants tasked by their father Mu with eternally holding up the vault of the sky to prevent it from falling on the earth and precipitating the end of the world. While at first they did so with the Pantokrator's blessing, after a short few eons He realized that their doing was maintaining a separation between His celestial domain and the material plane that was rightfully His, thus putting a limitation to His power: the Khôra. Outraged, the Pantokrator resolved to annihilate Mu and his entire creation. After having dismembered the Demiurge, whose putrefying body became the material plane's earthly membrane, He also put an end to the Age of Love he had built by tearing apart each and every one of his pure Androgyne children; and then, He attempted to slay the Mu-Atlaï as well. But each time His divine thunder stroke them, instead of dying their tortured bodies were cut in two halves just as great and powerful as the original ones. Eventually, the Mu-Atlaï, who until then hadn't retaliated in fear of letting the sky fall and doom all things, became so many that in their pain they threatened to destroy the whole world. So the Pantokrator took the sky on His shoulders and imprisoned them all, and beneath the earth they stayed until another Pantokrator released them to once again carry the Firmament's weight in His place. And although their power had dwindled, they relentlessly did so until now, standing at the furthest reaches of the world and keeping a benevolent eye on their beloved grand-children - creeping maggots for sure, but last offspring of Mu nonetheless -, the mortal blemmyes, whose guardian-protectors they became, seldom leaving the realm of legends to uplift them.
But now, having awakened from his geological slumber to rebuild the Old Dream, this Mu-Atlas shall restore his little ones' divinity by blessing them all at every battle start, even if non-sacred."

But each time His divine thunder stroke them, instead of dying their tortured bodies were cut in two halves just as great and powerful as the original ones. Eventually, the Mu-Atlaï, who until then hadn't retaliated in fear of letting the sky fall and doom all things, became so many that in their pain they threatened to destroy the whole world. So the Pantokrator took the sky on His shoulders and imprisoned them all, and beneath the earth they stayed until another Pantokrator released them to once again carry the Firmament's weight in His place. And although their power had dwindled, they relentlessly did so until now, standing at the furthest reaches of the world and keeping a benevolent eye on their beloved grand-children - creeping maggots for sure, but last offspring of Mu nonetheless -, the mortal blemmyes, whose guardian-protectors they became, seldom leaving the realm of legends to uplift them.
But now, having been awakened from his geological slumber by the conjugated power of five of his six brothers, the seventh Mu-Atlas shall endlessly self-replicate until this world is doomed."

Thus, it can easily be speculated that the old celestial edicts that dismembered Mu are still standing firm; and for that reason, that it is impossible for Teratons to merge into a single being at this time. In any case, even though they are devoid of magical abilities, Titanic Protozoons undoubtedly are among the most dangerous and nonsensical creatures of this world.

These prodigious leaps makes them functionally flying beings, which causes them to be very hard to escape; and their unsurpassable strength and vitality makes them extremely hard to kill or resist as well.

#name "Androgyne"
#descr "According to one of the most beautiful myths of U, the first sentient blemmyes - long before the birth of man - weren't actually sciapods. Instead, they were perfect beings gifted with a dual nature and a single will: they were Androgynes. Each had two opposite faces, four legs and four arms, but only one soul, and none of the psychological and emotional defects of the human heart. Rightfully, wisely and humbly enamored with their own self, they were true Avatars of Love and the most ravishing of all of the gods' creations. This was still the Age of Love, before violence and death were even born. But then, something happened and the Pantokrator decided to kill and dismember Mu along with his pure children. With divine lightning, he cut through them and separated them both body and mind in two incomplete halves each; and thus began the Age of Hatred and disharmony. The Androgynes no longer were anything more than blurred and confused memories of existential bliss and gentleness, hidden in the deepest parts of the now flawed, painful and mortal soul. Since then, sciapods and men alike crave from the bottom of their heart for the return of the angelic sister-half that completes them and agonizingly dream of joining her forever in total fusion, which explains why sciapods are as capable of love as humans all the while being sexless. And while truly marvelous ties of tenderness are possible in this world, they are but pale mimics of the beatific state of absolute amity and passion that all mortals secretly yearn for since their birth. But now, with the prophecies of Mu nearing their accomplishment, the Era of Love is on the verge of starting anew, and the Ideal Blemmyes, divine Androgynes, are once again blessing the world with their presence. As the metaphysical embodiments of inner beauty and cherishment, unifying Eros, Philia and Agape into a single, sublime emotion, they are stronger than death and hurting them is committing a universal crime against one's own self."

#descr "Maybe the most monstrous of all sentient blemmyes, the individualistic Eye Tyrants also are among the most intelligent and cruel. Rumored to be born from the eyes of Mu himself and speculated by some scholars to be heavily mutated protozoons closely related to Terminae, these absurd creatures are known for their incredibly vast ego as well as for their levitating body, seemingly made out of a single giant eye, a horrible jaw that devours souls and many small life-draining tentacles. Although they hate their own and usually refuse to serve anyone else than themselves - which also puts them apart from other blemmyes -, they relish in dominating others, especially sciapods, and some even claim that they are the true cause for the perversity and cannibalistic tendencies of Epiphagoi, who they often use as minions. In spite of their genius for evil, they are surprisingly easy to manipulate by exploiting their incomparable greed; thus, provided that some access to their deep underground lairs is possible - which is easy from the troglodyte networks of U -, they can easily be forced into submission in the name of the Awakening God in exchange for a great pact of blood guaranteeing the fulfillment of their hunger for magical might and for the flesh of lesser beings. Although the skin and cornea of Eye Tyrants are extremely vulnerable, their body remains bulky enough to endure profound wounds. Coupled with their immense mastery of blood magic and the frighteningly destructive powers of both their gaze and their bite, this makes them very dangerous dark sorcerers. In addition, Eye Tyrants are particularly efficient at leading demons in battle; in exchange for all these abilities, they must be allowed to devour about thirty people per month as specified by their magical contract, but this is indeed a very small price to pay for their loyalty."

Radiating with eerie energies and unsufferable heat, it has already started spreading madness in the whole region, uplifting mortals into worshipping it and the whole new world that is ready to spawn from it. Shining like a red moon under the solstice or the equinox, it is finally able to cast any of the Syzygy rituals, causing an anomalous celestial conjuction and allowing the impossible to come true. It is the chrysalis of a Wish opened with unlimited possibility - so who knows what manner of creature or event will be born from it on this day? Although it will inevitably disappear at the end of the month, it can complete one ritual or cause a colossal research boost before then. If killed in battle, it will generate a powerful blast that burns and paralyzes everyone in a huge area. In addition, it will automatically cast Astral Tempest at the start of any battle."

#descr "One of the strangest creatures that this world has seen - on par with void horrors or maybe even above them in the realms of impossibility -, Angel Eggs puzzle even beings as ancient as the few remaining Titans. Unlike what their name suggests, it is unknown whether they actually have anything to do with real angels, and to many scholars such a link looks unlikely; but their nature and purpose are so alien to mortals that there certainly is no word in any language to adequately describe them. An Angel Egg takes the shape of an irregular sphere of seemingly soft, living human flesh roughly twice as high as a human adult. In rare cases, an organism of this sort is reported to appear overnight in the middle of nowhere, with no trace or clue whatsoever as to where it came from or how it got there. Whenever this happens, it can stay there for months if left alone, without any apparent effect on the environment or people who guard or study it. But initial attempts to preserve them often ended badly, with all those close enough to observe the event suddenly disappearing along with the Egg itself, months after its apparition, leaving no remains except for intense magic residues and unnaturally burnt vegetation and equipment. Taking steps to contain the danger of these unexplainable ticking bombs, various authorities of the world eventually decided to destroy any Angel Egg they found, allowing only a few to experiment with them and only for a short time and under high surveillance before they effortlessly killed the apparently defenseless entity. Decades if not centuries of following that methodology eventually brought results; it was established that Angel Eggs are not from this world, that at least in the traditional sense they are not eggs, and that they are somehow connected both to blemmyes - who worship them - and to certain anomalous celestial events. Now, experts generally agree that they are much more dangerous than they seem and must be destroyed at all costs."

The most horrifying kind of Umbral there is, Obumbrals closely resemble Umbrals but also bear strange tentacles and tendrils on the back and the head. The rare Pale Ones that survived an encounter with them whisper that they are the souls of the Oracles who sacrificed themselves to Seal the Chamber; and now that they have been released, these monstrous entities have ascended to the sunlit world to command the Umbrals and Penumbrals in their alien designs, or maybe in a purely purposeless quest of destruction. Obumbrals are ethereal, undead beings capable of draining life from the living. They hold great powers over the realm of shadows and many among them have also received strange overwordly abilities from their millenary proximity to the God Vessels and the Seal. Owning an Agarthan Oracle or an Obumbral is necessary to recruit them."

#descr "In the deepest reaches of Agartha lies an ancient chamber sealed by forgotten magic. According to Agarthan lore, the Chamber contains three imprisoned gods of an earlier age, in truth the bodies of dead Titans and the only vessels capable of holding the innumerable god-spirits vanquished by the Pantokrator in the past. Should the Oracles of the Closed Council decide to worship as their pretender gods the members of this incredibly powerful Trinity, the Seal that must not be broken would be broken far sooner than could otherwise have been the case. As a result, when the God Vessels eventually awaken, all of the usual effects of Agartha's ultimate Alteration ritual will be achieved for free, except that for a very short amount of time the God Vessels will reward the Pale Ones by destroying their enemies. Then, they will one after the other abandon their followers and soon leave Agartha as a permanently godless nation whose only hope for survival is to claim the Thrones of Ascension in the name of the Closed Council and thus purify the Unleashed Trinity. The God Vessels are mages of nearly immeasurable power, and although their mastery of some paths is reduced, they benefit from very large magic boosts in others, in particular any Elemental path that they know, and their blessing will be permanently improved upon awakening if they master at least one of them.

#descr "In the deepest reaches of Agartha lies an ancient chamber sealed by forgotten magic. According to Agarthan lore, the Chamber contains three imprisoned gods of an earlier age, in truth the bodies of dead Titans and the only vessels capable of holding the innumerable god-spirits vanquished by the Pantokrator in the past. Should the Oracles of the Closed Council decide to worship as their pretender gods the members of this incredibly powerful Trinity, the Seal that must not be broken would be broken far sooner than could otherwise have been the case. As a result, when the God Vessels eventually awaken, all of the usual effects of Agartha's ultimate Alteration ritual will be achieved for free, except that for a very short amount of time the God Vessels will reward the Pale Ones by destroying their enemies. Then, they will one after the other abandon their followers and soon leave Agartha as a permanently godless nation whose only hope for survival is to claim the Thrones of Ascension in the name of the Closed Council and thus purify the Unleashed Trinity. The God Vessels are mages of nearly immeasurable power, and although their mastery of some paths is reduced, they benefit from very large magic boosts in others, in particular any Elemental path that they know, and their blessing will be permanently improved upon awakening if they master at least one of them. They also are nearly indestuctrible, but more than anything wish to die in order to be released from their prison of flesh and take on the even mightier form of an incorporeal Legion of Gods.

#descr "Nitzotz, the Spark of Creation, is one of the most powerful manifestations of Bethel She'em's God, only able to appear after the Sephira of Splendor has been cast. Taking the shape of an ever-blazing explosion of light and fire in the skies, it is like a window to eternity or a second sun in darkness, and it ensures that even while the God performs Tzimtzum his faithful will never lose sight of their sacred mission. In addition to protecting the Holy City against both invaders and the twists of destiny, every time a Sephira is successfully cast it will open up to let a new Virtue descend upon this world. Furthermore, even though Nitzotz is completely immobile and cannot leave Bethel She'em even with the help of magic, in battle it will act as a powerful focus of Fire magic and attempt to destroy opposition with a tempest of divine wrath if there is ever a need for it. As such, it will start every battle with a power equivalent to five temporary gems of Fire."

#name "Golden Asp Assassin" -- watershape
#descr "In Erytheia, politics have always been veiled in secrecy and there is a long though esoteric tradition of assassination. The legendary Order of the Golden Asp may be the most impressive mark of that heritage. Founded several decades ago by one of the greatest Erytheian queens there ever was, it was fully loyal to its mistress and originally had only one purpose: to protect her and further her glory, especially against the Triton Empire. But that queen became enamored with Ermor's young prince, and while she remained beloved and admired by her people, this unconventional love raised jealousy and sedition among the nobility. Her rivals started conspiring against her, aware that her royal assassins made it impossible to attack her directly, but knowing of a much more tortuous method to reach her, one against which none of her guards or enchantments could do anything. Spreading lies like venom away from the queen's influence, they skillfully convinced her betrothed that she had been killed and drew him to despair - thus also gaining among humans the still surviving reputation of viper tongues for their whole kin. Mad with pain and sorrow, the prince took his own life away, and it was already far too late to save him when the queen learned of that incident. In her gloom, the royal mistress of poisons for the last time made use of her art, this time to devise her own suicide, the most beautiful and poetic she could think of. Putting her hand in a luxurious cup of fruits as a last toast to life, she willingly let one of her carefully raised asps mortally wound her, softly biting the very wrist that usually carried it. Following this national tragedy, the Order of the Golden Asp fell between the hands of her enemies, only for them to continually use it to destroy one another, unaware that this was the Assassins' plan all along. And now that their vengeance is complete, they have finally joined the Awakening God to once and for all restore the Setting Sun's glory."

Initially, the Demonbreds were not entrusted with magical training and were instead used as Slayers. The life of a Slayer is short and it soon became evident that the Demonbreds' skills and magical aptitude were better suited for other uses. Now, the Demonbreds that succeed in their missions are trained in the arcane arts by Ba'al Chozron. Chuzrael however is an exception. In order to remain in perfect control of his servant, his master and creator has stripped him of the right to learn Fire magic. Instead, his inner potential was crystallized in the form of the ability to return to life everytime he is killed. It is therefore no surprise that he has lived for ages and has mastered the craft of assassination. Chuzrael's demonic ancestry makes him very difficult to detect. His demonic nature is also made manifest in his appetite. Chuzrael reputedly feeds on the hearts of his victims after slaying them, and he will become more powerful with each of his murders. He is an extremely talented killer and in battle will move and attack at twice the normal speed."

#descr "One fateful day a short few millenia ago, an enigmatic empire appeared overnight in the depths of the sea, at first hidden but already prosperous and promised to a great destiny: the Illithid realm centered around the Sunken City of R'lyeh. Back then, hidden as well in the abyssal depths and the shadow of the mortal kingdoms it secretly aspired to take back from the gods, only the Elder Race of the Aboleths had noticed the incredibly quick ascension of its new rival, and, as primordial beings blessed with an infallible genetic memory who claimed to have seen the very birth of the gods and to remember everything, they felt deeply disturbed by the sudden emergence of the utterly unknown Illithids and their impossibly young civilization. For the first time in their history, the Aboleths felt fear, for they faced something they couldn't remember or understand; so they decided to delay their conquest of the world and to remain hidden and patiently observe. With time however, as they would secretly start to spread their sprawling influence through Illithid society and to slowly put into motion their plans to make of R'lyeh a tool towards their own goals, they would incidentally and unknowingly come to locate the Star from which these alien beings came and to interpret it as the powerful mystical sign of their future glory - possibly a correct omen of their superiority, or possibly a terrible mistake which they would eventually painfully regret. But regardless of the truth, the Aboleths are no longer scared now, and although some remain intolerably annoyed by the existence of such a living counter-evidence to their omniscience, others have decided that the minds of the Illithids are to their taste and have deemed them useful as food for the Aboleths and as slavemasters for the weaker races. Phnglua is one such Aboleth and has proven to be the most effective one at taking control of the Illithids."

#name "Last Uobilyth"
#descr "In eons so ancient that all but a few gods and the Aboleths themselves have forgotten everything about them, the Elder Race was still divided in two separate species, very closely related to each other but set apart by a millenary mutual hatred and rivalry. One, the Aboleths as we know them, was dominant and survived to this day; the other, the mysterious Uobilyths, was almost completely wiped out by the gods when they rose against its stronger sibling, who already was forcing it into hiding anyway long before then. The fact that the Uobilyths were a minority however doesn't mean at any rate that they were weak. Using extremely powerful magic to change their own essence and become innately able levitate, control the air and command the Mist at will as well as to dwell freely within the clouds high above the surface, the first Uobilyths originally were regular Mind Lords and willingly chose to leave the path of the Aboleths to forge their own. The fact that their origins weren't natural explains why they were so few, and if these aerial leviathans were unable to create an equally mighty empire as that of their aquatic cousins, it was mostly because of their highly individualistic nature and of the fact that, unlike Aboleths, they hated order, cooperation, permanent structures and social interactions of all kinds. Thus, most Uobilyths were content to roam the seas of clouds for millenia, feeding upon the dreams and psyche of mortals as well as the lives of any being foolish enough to cross their path in such a vast and faraway domain. Sadly for them, this way of thought was highly antithetical to that of the more organized Aboleths, which caused them to soon be seen as heretics and rebels, until the gods finally put an end to their celestial reign. In spite of this, at least one Uobilyth, Xxiphu, escaped the divine hunt, and he survived to finally join the Unseen Dominance in a most unexpected alliance and in the hope of one day bringing back to life his entire kind."

#name "Reassembled Prince"
#descr "Udum'ukinna was the firstborn son of Ekishnugal, the First King. When the kingdom found itself threatened by the Priest-King Etimmu and his host of shades, Udum'ukinna led the lizard host against the spectral legions with great success. But Udum'ukinna and his generals were surprised by a cowardly sneak-attack by shades in the night. Etimmu, who had learned necromancy from the Sauromancers, was afraid that the Sauromancers would revive the Royal Heir. He dismembered the body of Udum'ukinna and placed his body parts in thirteen secret vaults. But Udum'ukinna had a lover and companion who, torn by grief, traveled to the Shaded Lands and uncovered the body parts of the Prince and reassembled him and gave him back life. But Zilammu failed to find one piece of his body. The Reassembled Prince has no tail. Such was the power of Zilammu's Ritual of Rebirth that Udum'ukinna was not just reborn, but became truly immortal. However, his new body could not harbor love and he and his companion parted ways. Now he appears from time to time to aid his King. In battle he is incredibly difficult to kill, for under the effect of Zilammu's powerful enchantment his bones might immediately reform after his body has been seemingly destroyed."

#descr "Zilammu is the only known female to have become a Sauromancer. She devoted her life to the study of life, death and rebirth during the time of Ekishnugal's reign, when magic was less formalized. She came to know Udum'ukinna, the son of the First King, and became his companion and lover until he was dismembered by Etimmu. Zilammu gave up her position in the Order and left for the Shaded Lands where she found and reassembled her lover in a great Ritual of Rebirth. Udum'ukinna became immortal, but true life was not returned to him. Instead, he lives on in a dried husk, incapable of love or tender emotions, and Zilammu and Udum'ukinna parted ways. Zilammu has returned to the Kingdom, but rarely aids the Sauromancers, whom she distrusts. Her exceptional talent allowed her to innovate in the practice of the Sauromancers' arts and to perfect the rituals of rebirth to previously unmatched efficiency, in such a way that her own body will return to true life if she dies after having cast Twiceborn - a secret that allowed her to live for centuries and which she refuses to share with anyone."

#descr "Soon after the benevolent Devatas left the dense forests of the Bandar realm, a long era of chaos began in the absence of their leadership. Under the malignant influence of the Lankan demons, countless ape kings were corrupted over the course of a few centuries and waged war against each other, in their blind pride bringing endless suffering to the monkey people of Bandar Log. Even though there were periods of apparent peace and prosperity, evil was always lurking somewhere in the Bandars' palaces. But eventually, a young and heroic White One warrior named Pulakeshin used his skills as a leader, as well as the clear sign of his divine favor, to restore unity and order to his people. Brave, pure of heart and talented with words, he seemed to be an envoy of the Celestials and eventually sealed evil away from Bandar Log, allowing the kingdom to finally retrieve durable balance and happiness and in the process receiving the honorary title of White Prince from the few untainted and now victorious Bandar kings. Since then, decades have passed but Pulakeshin, blessed with a rare longevity, remained adulated by the people and now still serves the Greater Good under his Rishi masters' wise guidance. Pulakeshin is a great general, priest and warrior gifted with preternatural luck. In one of his most famous deeds, he succeeded in befriending a sacred white tiger that agreed to carry him in battle; like brothers of soul, they never went separate ways since then and the White Prince still can be seen riding his noble mount to this day. It is a great honor to fight alongside him, and as such one zealous Tiger Rider will join him each month. Pulakeshin's personal guard consisting of five tiger riders always follows him in combat, and should one of their number fall he would soon be replaced with another volunteer."

Barhisakav was mesmerized by the being's grace and skill as it danced through the villains. Since then, he knew that there is beauty in death and would not rest until he had achieved the same kind of perfection. As he grew up, Barhisakav trained vigorously, honing his skills and coming up with new steps for his deadly dance. He has travelled far and wide, bested many foes and trained under many masters. Now his life's work is complete and he is the master of the Dance of Blades. Few foes can now stand against him, and even fewer can land a blow through his shield of blades. Barhisakav will quicken himself at the start of each battle so that he can keep his dance up to the chaotic rhythm of war. Many White Ones will also come to receive his teachings in the arts of war, so he can spend the month training five sacred warriors whenever he doesn't wish to personally join the battle."

The Oracle proved to be quite clever, but not clever enough to avoid capture. It was released by the Lion Kings when Mwaka, the Crowned Ape, arrived and made a plea for the Oracle's life. Mchumba seems to be only slightly brighter than an ordinary Ape, but she has impressive innate magical powers."

Carnon grew up far from the sacred Forest of Carnutes, but wanted to become a Boar Warrior. Unfortunately, he was Marverni by birth and was not allowed to enter the sacred forest. He defied the Druids and entered the Forest full of rage. Deep inside Carnutes he found an ancient hill with a westward opening. Outside the opening stood a huge boar with sentient eyes. Carnon promptly slew the boar and entered the tomb. Inside lay the remains of an ancient warrior clad in gold. While a thunderhead was building up outside, he donned the armor of the entombed warrior. Armed like a warrior from the past, he emerged from the tomb, raised his hands and was struck by lightning. When he came to, he was changed, possessed and cursed with the head of a stag. Carnon returned to the Druids and was given soldiers to lead. Now he serves the Druids with unfailing loyalty, and so do the ghostly guardians of the ancient sepulture he once disturbed and now represents. As such, the Antlered One will unknowingly cast Dance of the Morrigans at the start of every battle, thus continually summoning to his help sacred and fear-inducing Morrigan apparitions as the ground is soiled with the blood of his unholy enemies."

#name "Iron Brotherhood Mercenary"
#descr "There is a long history of mercenary employment in Porphyrion. When the rebellion against Phlegra began, at first it was a spontaneous popular movement and the Gigantes didn't have any trouble keeping the poorly equipped, inexperienced and disorganized revolutionaries in check. But some Oppressors quickly realized that this revolt presented them with great opportunities, so they decided to support it and sought out ways of creating real armies. The heart of their strategy consisted in surprising the Gigantes by strengthening, uniting and arming their previously mediocre opponents, and they used many clever tricks to reach that goal; but from the very beginning of their involvement in that war, they first and foremost leaned on one specific tactical asset to reach it: their very first step was ensuring with bribes and smart diplomacy that all of the region's professional mercenaries were on their side, and from then on they've put to optimal use that monopoly of the independent armed forces they controlled. Thus, mercenaries always were among the Oppressors' closest allies, blessed with freedom and riches beyond measure in exchange for the gift of their strength, lives and absolute loyalty even in the face of injustice. This fact remains true to this day, especially since Porphyrion now possesses the most advanced techniques of metallurgy in the whole world, which attracts sellswords of all horizons; and in turn, many Porphyrian soldiers have attempted to regain their freedom by being recruited by authorized mercenary groups. Those that succeed in that task eventually even may leave the country to join more clement lords; but most willingly come back when they realize that their life is easier when they are allowed to bully the people and take part in the tyranny they originally desired to flee. Led by the cruel Procrustos, the elite Iron Brotherhood is among the most brutal of these legalized brigand groups and serves the Oppressors with great satisfaction."

#name "Iron Brotherhood Champion"
#descr "Procrustos is the leader of a very dangerous organization known as the Iron Brotherhood and one of the most brutal and infamous of all Porphyrian mercenaries. He is so strong and cruel that some suspect he might have some Gigante ancestry, but there is no doubt that he obeys the Oppressors with great joy, for they grant him nearly any right he desires. Thus, along with his men - who may be the most heavily armed soldiers in the world and enjoy the same freedom as their exalted champion -, he has secured his position as the entirely unofficial but very much authorized and unopposed Lord of the Crossroads in Porphyrion. As such, he controls all trade in a large region of the kingdom and in particular claims ownership of the entire metallurgic industry in his lands. Under his orders, the Iron Brotherhood therefore lives off the work of many towns whose sole economic activity is ore extraction and forging. Undoubtedly, the distinction between a mercenary and a brigand is thin in Porphyrion, especially since that kind of tyrannical bullying is often allowed by the Oppressors, who care more about their soldiers' loyalty than about the well-being of the people. This explains why the behavior of so many mercenary lords as petty local kings is tolerated by the true rulers of these regions and why they are more than happy to leave that lazy life whenever the Archons call for their aid; but Procrustos is certainly the worst among them, and he is feared for very good reason. Indeed, to prove his legitimacy as the supervisor of all metalworkers and their families, he proudly takes upon himself the responsibility of showing anyone who opposes his authority his skills with the hammer. After having tied them up to his special bed, he works on the rebels' bodies to make them fit by either stretching their limbs when too short or amputating them when too long. Since nobody ever fits the bed perfectly, Procrustos has never been proven wrong and his reign of terror is far from over."

#descr "One of the greatest statesmen, orators and generals of Arcoscephalean history, Periklas has been elected as a Great Strategos by the aristocratic Democracy that leads the central and most important of the City-States, the kingless capital, the city of philosophers. Since then, he has elevated the nation to unprecedented heights and in effect became the Confederacy's supreme leader, even though each individual City-State retains its own political system and sometimes a still influential king. Known for his great skills both in war and in peace, Periklas is an extremely talented and innovative tactician but also shines in diplomacy, logistics and economical management. After having won a series of crucial battles in command of the Arcoscephalean forces following a cautious strategy focusing on naval power, his mandate was prolonged and he obtained enough political leverage to reform in depth the Arcoscephalean constitution, causing his opponents within the Democracy to lose all hope of prematurely ending his career. Periklas is a clever and authoritive ruler able to organize the populace to best utilize all resources available to them, but he is also a very charismatic leader and a capable sailor able to organize large naval expeditions. His careful planning takes into account all possibilities, and his words of greatness exalt his troops with such confidence in victory that they have the same effect as a spell of Antimagic cast at the start of every battle he personally takes a part in."

#descr "Menelaos is Agamemnous' younger brother and the most loyal of his followers. Divine-blooded like his sibling, he is blessed with outstanding charisma, virtue and strength and he rules as a king over one of Arcoscephale's most important City-States, in addition to being the rightful heir to the capital's throne should it one day abandon democracy and come back to its monarchic roots. In the past, he received the honor of marrying the most beautiful mortal woman in the world, but a perfidious foreign prince eventually took her from him and a great war began as a result. After a seemingly endless siege and countless losses in both sides, that war ended in a terrible stalemate and Menelaos failed to retrieve his queen. But even then Menelaos did not lose hope and instead he became one of the most ardent defenders of Arcoscephale's interests in war. His bravery, honor and fidelity are such that he earned the title of Lion Heart, often leading Arcoscephale's armies in conquest. And now, with Agamemnous' recent call to war, finally seeing the opportunity to once again attempt to recover his beloved wife, he was the first one to fulfill his pledge and to join his brother's vast armada."

#descr "In the waters near the great City-States of Arcoscephale, there are many inhabited islands ruled by heroic kings. Before the coming of Agamemnous, these insular kings could not rest because in their pride and jealousy they were constantly at war one against another. The divine-blooded Agamemnous changed this situation and gave them peace by taking up the role of an arbitrator whose legitimacy everyone recognized, thus proving his qualities as a just and fair ruler. In order to force the kings to behave as brothers with respect and honor, he made them swear a sacred oath to defend each other should one of them betray that newfound unity. With Agamemnous above all of them as the only one deserving of the title of King of Kings, the insular kings since then took the duty to protect their alliance above all else and promised to come to his aid in times of need. Now, the call has been made and the oath must be fulfilled. Accordingly, this king has sailed to aid Agamemnous accompanied with a small retinue of elite soldiers."

#descr "Agamemnous the Great is the powerful king of one of the most ancient and noble City-States of Arcoscephale, although not of the capital itself. As a direct descendant of the Gods, he is blessed with divine blood, innate magical power, supernatural longevity, priestly authority and great wisdom of both heart and mind. Since the beginning of his reign, he has worked relentlessly to unite all Arcoscephalean kings under a single banner and to ensure that they properly honor the Awakening God by their words and actions. Through both diplomacy and conquest, he eventually achieved that goal and by doing so elevated Arcoscephale's Confederacy to unprecedented glory and prosperity. Earning the uncontested title of King of Kings in the process, he surpassed all other individual Arcoscephaleans in political power and status save for whoever the God elected as his prophet. Although Arcoscephale's capital and therefore the Confederacy as a whole remains ultimately controlled by its kingless aristocratic Democracy of philosophers, sages, orators and strateges, Agamemnous' influence still vastly supersedes that of other Arcoscephalean kings, and his decisions sometimes have such an impact on the nation that no vote or assembly can prevent their fruition at the hands of the warrior nobility and the lowborn population. Using this unmatched authority to further cement the Confederacy's position of strength in the world and his own, Agamemnous has spent the last century leading his followers both in peace and in war, sometimes making himself responsible for history-warping conflicts. As a result of all the deaths and suffering that he inevitably caused, he also has made powerful enemies and recent oracles have predicted a terrible fate for Agamemnous and his entire dynasty; but most of his vassals still believe in him with great loyalty, and now that Agamemnous has once again sounded the call of war, one royal-blooded sailing commander will join him every three months on average."

The young boy was then hidden away in the temple to protect him from jealous titans. When he reached maturity, he left the temple and has since traveled to distant lands with his divine legacy and his martial skills as his weapons. Now he has returned to his land of birth, and for his great deeds the celestial powers have rewarded him with true immortality.

Watched by the hidden Kryptes, all Gigantes are evaluated for their loyalty and their skills, and when one of them shows exceptionally promising qualities, he may be chosen by the current Master of the Krypteia to become one of his close contacts and potential successors. Should he accept this burden and undergo initiation to the arcane secrets of the Krypteia, he would be rid of his name entirely and join the ranks of the Unnamed Ones, who serve as civil agents and representatives of the Krypteia from within Mekone's magistrature. Then, whenever the Master of the Krypteia dies, the most talented of these Unnamed Ones is elected by his peers to replace him and receives full access to the archives of the secret police as well as the key to the legendary Seal of Krypteia, which among other powers grants him supernatural longevity and more importantly absolute authority over the Kryptes by allowing him to encrypt and decrypt at will communications with his agents. As such, the Master of the Krypteia is the most skilled of all Gigante assassins and will work relentlessly towards the completion of a world-wide web of information and intrigue. In addition to being a grand master of illusions, manipulation and counter-espionage, the supreme leader of Mekone's intelligence will teach an elite of Kryptes some of his skills. Thus, starting from the moment of the Master of the Krypteia's apparition, all Mekonean Kryptes will become spies as well as assassins, acquire some skills in illusion and receive an efficient fighting training to better accomplish their tasks."

#name "Shackled Elder"
#descr "When the Elder Cyclopes were rounded up in Porphyrion following the war against Phlegra, Steropes was among the first to be enslaved. With his great skill in magecraft, alchemy, forging and jewelry, the Oppressor Archons cruelly forced him to aid them in improving the design of their iron headbands originally created by Phlegyas, the Theurg Tyrant of Ermor, and used to control both the shackled smiths and shackled mages of Porphyrion. Eventually, his innovations allowed the Oppressors to destroy their human soldiers' fear and free will with the creation of their tragically famed Iron Bound corps, possibly making of their kingdom the most stable and unbreakable tyranny in the world. Later, Steropes' knowledge of the implements of his enslavement allowed him to escape. However, Steropes found himself to be too remorseful for his part in the enslavement of so many of his own kind and could not enjoy his freedom nor hope for the forgiveness of his last unchained brothers in Mekone and Phlegra. For him, no water or wine truly satisfied his thirst and even honey was not sweet. Steropes has now returned and willingly placed himself in shackles in order to, perhaps, free himself from the chains of his own guilt. Some Archons suspect that he might be conspiring against them in his loneliness, but greater care than ever before has been taken to ensure that he won't be able to harm them in any way, and his jailors believe that nothing but torment and love for the arts of the forge inhabits his broken mind any longer."

But Porphyrion was wise and prudent enough to foresee that terrible outcome, and thus he refused to take part in the war. Instead, he led half of the Gigantes to another land and there he founded the City of Gold and Marble with their help, thus becoming their king, the first of the Mekonean Basilei. Together, these Gigantes established a new kingdom with the sole purpose of one day truly efficiently opposing the Pantokrator and his servants, should their Phlegran brothers fail in their reckless attempt, and today the brazen giants of Mekone have finally begun putting their flawlessly designed plan into action, at last reaping the fruits of millenia of preparation. But that plan of conquest and glory doesn't include Porphyrion himself any longer, for the very individual that originally devised it has himself deviated from it, if only a little, and suffered from that mistake's harsh consequences to the fullest, losing his mind in the process. Indeed, after having established the kingdom of Mekone and watched Phlegra's terrible defeat from afar, as the war had ended and as the Pantokrator was starting to punish those responsible for that betrayal, Porphyrion dared to speak in the favor of his Phlegran brothers and the Telkhines, asking the Great One for clemency. By doing so, not only did he fail to reach his intended aim, but he also unleashed the Pantokrator's full wrath upon himself far sooner that he was willing to. Thus, punished in the very same way as those that he defended, he was cursed as the Last of the Laestrygonians and buried alive under the land that now bears his name: Porphyrion."

Kratios was one of that deity's direct sons, and as such, along with his elder brother Enkelados, first of the Gigantes, he bore the dignity of a demigod and embodied pure strength. For centuries upon centuries, he watched the unfair rule of the gods and obeyed his father's commands in the Pantokrator's name, knowing deep inside that things had to change, but still doubting his own judgment. During the Telkhines' rebellion, he was ordered to fight them and did so with unmatched honor and ferocity, but when he finally met in combat his own brother, who had allied with them and led the Gigantes of Phlegra in their betrayal, he realized the horror of the situation. Knowing that the Pantokrator couldn't be vanquished anymore, he tried to convince his brother to ask for forgiveness and return, but he failed and ultimately had to take upon himself the responsibility for his eternal imprisonment, hatred and madness. After the war, while the Gigantes who had abstained from opposing the Pantokrator founded the kingdom of Mekone under the great Prophyrion's guidance, Kratios rejected his own godhood and started working in secret on the perfect god-slaying weapon, the dreadful ichor-drinking whips of rage and fire which he still wields to this day. When finally the Pantokrator disappeared and the God-Slayer manifested before him, electing him as his champion, Kratios gladly embraced his new mission and killed his own father, thus freeing the entire race of Gigantes and making himself the First of the Deicides among them. And now, with the long-awaited proclamation of the War upon the Gods, he has returned to chase and slaughter all remaining deities and their servants. Kratios is a warrior of incredible skill who alone is capable of wielding the God-Slayer Whips, which cancel the immortality of whoever they kill. In his semi-divine wrath, he is also able to cast spells twice as fast as other mages."

He fights with his jaws and a morningstar of black iron that destroys the armor of those struck. He always wears black scale mail and is always followed by his famous band of loyal and skilled falchioneers. He is a specialist of ambush tactics and will always find a way to sneak in enemy territory with his trained soldiers."

#name "First King"
#descr "Ekishnugal was the First King and founder of the ancient kingdom of Aabydum, long before the birth of C'tis. His memory still lives in the legends of both kingdoms. He was mummified in a great tomb ages ago and has rested peacefully ever since. In recent times, the Sauromancers of Aabydum have tried to locate his hidden tomb in order to reawaken the legendary king. When the tomb was found, the traps inside killed many intruders, but finally the Ritual of Rebirth was completed and the First King emerged in unholy splendor. Ekishnugal is a powerful, immortal mage of Death and a mighty priest of the dead. He wears a mask of jade to give him a semblance of life. His legendary status inspires C'tissians to great deeds."

#descr "A Garnet Adventurer's Eternal Love is by far her most valuable possession; she'd gladly die for him, just as she'd kill him without hesitation if he ever betrayed her trust. Although generally far less experienced and skillful than her beloved one, such a man usually has learned his own share of skills while following the Garnet Adventurer during her journeys. Both out of sincere feeling and out of social obligation, an Eternal Love is very faithful to his wife. He would accompany her anywhere in the world and generally helps her with an enchanted bow during battles."

#name "Garnet Adventurer"
#descr "In the Garnet Tribes, a very ancient tradition called the Hunt wills that a young Amazon leaves her homeland alone when reaching adulthood and travels across the whole world in quest for eternal love, only coming back when victorious. Taking part in this ritual is always a personal choice, for it can take years or even a lifetime for such a chase to reach its conclusion, and for such a long journey towards the unknown can and will include a great share of danger. But the Amazons, especially in the Garnet Tribe, very rarely shy away from danger, and their inner flame gives them an innate tendency towards this kind of passionate idealism. Those among the Amazons that willingly comply with this tradition earn the name of Garnet Adventurers and, should they both survive and keep their cultural ties, frequently obtain during their travels a very wide array of skills both as fighters and as explorers as well as many useful magical items from which they draw an even greater power. The few that come back are even called Heroines and admired by most Amazons, thus inspiring a new generation of young Garnet Adventurers. Although in the recent times the tradition of the Hunt has been somewhat discouraged in the lands of Zun in particular due to the rise of ideological misandry as well as of institutional homosexuality, it remains very popular among the people, especially since it never has really contradicted the Zunnite philosophy in the first place: a Garnet Adventurer's Eternal Love is merely her possession, and she has full right of life and death over him, just like with any other slave. This is not a matter of debate in Zun, and even successful Garnet Adventurers usually sincerely consider this way of thought as the only natural one, thus being as possessive with their male trophy as they are protective of him. Although the male himself is not necessarily unhappy in such a relationship, he also has no freedom whatsoever, and only him ought to remain monogamous."

#descr "It is said that in the early days of Zun, as the Renascent Evil had succeeded in vanquishing the Vestals and becoming their black monarch, seven legendary Amazon heroines united their forces to defeat him and end his dark reign. These sacred warriors were armed with supernatural weapons bestowed by the gods and thanks to their immense courage they stroke the Evil down from his throne for the first time. Although the Renascent Evil was promised by a prophecy to come back every century to once again attempt to bring Zun under his tyrannical dominion and lead it to glory, and although the Seven Heroines all died before his return, their marvelous deeds and decisive victory inspired the Amazons with an unbreakable will to fight back - which allowed them to never again be entirely defeated -, and they are still celebrated to this day during several festivities all across the Zunnite calendar. In honor of these heroines, seven monumental statues were carved from the stone of the desert, where they were tasked with eternally watching over the kingdom. But centuries have passed, and today, all of them are lost, either fallen in ruins or resting in forgotten places as a mysterious reminder of a long gone past. Now, as with the Ascension Wars dire times have once again come upon Zun, Nurboosa, one of the Seven Heroines, has decided to come back in the form of a holy spirit communicating with the Amazons from beyond the veil of death through the vessel that is her statue - and several of her sisters might do the same as well, thus renewing their ancient union. The Statue of the Heroine is of colossal size and incredibly difficult to destroy in battle. Its incomparable nobility inspires the greatest of respects even from its opponents and makes them hesitate from striking it as the light of the God shines upon it. Its priestly authority is akin to that of a prophet and it still retains its ancient secrets, among which that of the mighty and forgotten magic of the sands."

#descr "Orokestes became a temple servant at the age of five and was castrated like all male servants of the temples. At the age of fifteen, he tried to perform the secret Rites of Healing to restore his lost manhood. Orokestes was discovered and banished from the temple. He found his way to a cave of mystics where he was initiated, but he soon grew tired of their cave and strange rituals. He left the mystics to find other wise men. On this long search for knowledge, he learned much of magic, but he never found the means to heal himself. Finally, he found enlightenment and became the Great Hierophant, or priestly leader, of a group of exalted mystics in the service of the Great Lord of Delphanes. Even some orphic mystics are now coming from far away to listen to his teachings, and from the wisest of their mystery cult leaders he has himself learned the secret of immortality."

She and her sisters became known as the Kabeirides, mothers of the Kabeiroi craftsmen. When Therodos fell and became the Telkhine Spectre, Axieros fled to the lands of Delphanes where she joined a temple and became a priestess of remarkable skills. Her magical powers rival the Therodian Hekaterides and her martial prowess as well as strategic abilities are indisputable.

#descr "Phlegyas, the Theurg Tyrant, was born and educated in Ermor as a Theurg and master of the Theurg Communion, a secretive order of mystics and mages that is promised a great future in the empire. Overly ambitious he found himself caught up in political games. He soon made himself powerful enemies in the church and found himself outmaneuvered by the masters of the game. He was accused of sacrilege and was exiled from Ermor. For the time he put his political aspirations aside and left for Phlegra to study ancient lore. Having skills beyond most Trophimoi he was well received by the Tyrants. However, he soon discovered that the Gigantes were unfit to rule the human population and he took it upon himself to dominate and coerce the humans into docile servitude. Having mastered the arcane techniques used by the Theurgs of Ermor he offered the Tyrants his knowledge in return for power over his fellow men. Together with the Elder Cyclopes he forged the arcane shackles used to dominate magically trained individuals. For a time he became master of an arcane communion to rival that of the theurgic order, but the Tyrants recognized the power of communal arcana and coerced Phlegyas to work with the Cyclopes and forge master headbands, so that more Trophimoi could lead the communion. Phlegyas still serves the Tyrants as the most influential of the Oppressors, but, like the Porphyrian Oppressors that he inspired and who eventually rebelled, he resents the fact that he no longer is the sole master of the shackled mages. He has since vied for new avenues of power and has started to reform the divided church of Phlegra. As a former Theurg he has become the single most influential priest in the kingdom."

Instead, he did the impossible: with his words alone he convinced the Amazon war-leaders that it was unreasonable to kill or even imprison him. Unable to answer his perfect arguments, the Amazons were baffled and let him live. Since then, he has completely abandoned blood magic to show his sincerity and proved it publicly and with great spectacle. Shortly thereafter, he vanished, living in hiding, alone with his own tortured ideas. Now, having mysteriously obtained a supernatural longevity, he has reemerged to answer the call of the Awakening God, and although he will never accept the Amazons as his superiors, he will still serve the Awakening God to the best of his abilities, which is a great deal indeed thanks to his vast knowledge and significant magical skills - especially if he's allowed to teach the Cloud Monks, far away from the eyes of the Amazons, where he will be free to act as a very efficient inspiring researcher. Why does he do so? Maybe as a tribute, maybe to demonstrate his good will, or maybe because he knows there is no other rational course of action when facing a divine entity. But even then, never will he be a completely orthodox follower of his cult; never will he stop spreading his aphorisms and their unfathomable conclusions; and no-one can say with certitude whether he has ulterior plans and motives or not."

#fixedname "Isosthenos"
#descr "When the reign of the Tyrant-Philosophers ended, most were killed. The few who remained fled Thalamanth and survived. However, only one neither died nor fled: Isosthenos. Instead, he did the impossible: with his words alone he convinced the Amazon war-leaders that it was unreasonable to kill or even imprison him. Unable to answer his perfect arguments, the Amazons were baffled and let him live. Since then, he has completely abandoned blood magic to show his sincerity and proved it publicly and with great spectacle. Shortly thereafter, he vanished, living in hiding, alone with his own tortured ideas. Now, having mysteriously obtained a supernatural longevity, he has reemerged to answer the call of the Awakening God, and although he will never accept the Amazons as his superiors, he will still serve the Awakening God to the best of his abilities, which is a great deal indeed thanks to his vast knowledge and significant magical skills - especially if he's allowed to teach the Cloud Monks, far away from the eyes of the Amazons, where he will be free to act as a very efficient inspiring researcher. Why does he do so? Maybe as a tribute, maybe to demonstrate his good will, or maybe because he knows there is no other rational course of action when facing a divine entity. But even then, never will he be a completely orthodox follower of his cult; never will he stop spreading his aphorisms and their unfathomable conclusions; and no-one can say with certitude whether he has ulterior plans and motives or not."

Having attained immortality through meditation long ago, Gathaspa is the eldest of the three and therefore is called the First. They all originate from a different nation of the Far East, which they left and betrayed when foreseeing the Awakening of the True God of the Sky. They then gathered as many followers as they could and began a long journey across the world to reach the holy city of Thalamanth where the God was prophesied to start his new reign. They all met by chance or by destiny before reaching their purpose, and seeing that their goals and beliefs were so similar, they united their forces into a single order. When finally their pilgrimage came to its end, together the three Most-Wise-Kings escalated the steps of the Pythias' marble palace, and each offered a precious gift from the East and told the council of their prophecy, asking humbly to become loyal servants of the kingdom and its new God. The council of Pythias spent three nights and days secluded from the world scrutinizing the stars and the flight of birds, and it finally reached the conclusion that the Most-Wise-Kings' prophecy was true and that they should be accepted. Since then, they have been roaming the lands of Thalamanth to organize the Cloud Sages in their tasks and to prepare the people for a new age. Although they were prophets of the God and still retain their ability to read the future, they abandoned most of their religious power except over the Cloud Sages themselves when they became a part of the Crystal hierarchy. Each Most-Wise-King is an extremely powerful air mage and knows how to fly, and each is the master of an additional path. Finally, each knows how to use one of their holy gifts - for Gathaspa, the Chime of the Celestial Dance -, which must first be infused with magical power through advanced magical item forging, to create a mountain sanctuary for the Dragon spirits of the East."

#descr "It is not entirely clear whether Psappho is an Amazon or not. It is true that she's a woman and a leader, that she's the undisputed master of a tower entirely made of crystal, and that she shares many cultural ties with the denizens of Thalamanth. On the other hand, she leads an independent faction, doesn't recognize the absolute authority of Thalamanth, and deeply disagrees with its warrior philosophy. Psappho is a very powerful mage akin to the Crystal Astrologers, but she is before all else a teacher and has made it her life's work to share her secrets with all those that earn her trust - a generosity that the lonely Astrologers avoid jealously. Although she still bears great beauty, she is very old and she seemingly always has been the Crystal Tower's mistress. There, every decade, a few young women are selected among devoted applicants that may come from all around the world. They then form a very narrow circle of students, sisters and lovers, all extremely loyal to Psappho, and Psappho takes the next decade to teach them all that is most sacred to her: poetry, music, singing, dancing, love between women, magic, mathematics and, more than anything else, wisdom and philosophy. Although Psappho is mostly known as a magician, a teacher and a poet - whose hymns glorify the gods and the captivating beauty of her lovers and their fragile youth, men and women alike -, she is also considered a philosopher, which is by far the most scandalous thing about her in Thalamanth along with her sympathy with men, since her other views about love have gradually become more common in Amazon society. However, since she has so many admirable qualities, among them great benevolence and respect for the sacred, but mainly since she's a woman and a powerful magician, her sloth, luxury, intellectual hubris and lack of warrior spirit are all tolerated even by her rivals. Now, Psappho has freely chosen to serve the Awakening God and no-one will oppose the Tower's reunion with Thalamanth."

#descr "In its last great war against Arcoscephale, the Divine Citadel was held under siege for ten entire years, and although it resisted the invaders this whole time and in the end avoided ruin, its people and its military both suffered terribly. However, it is its royalty which suffered the most: of all the fifty-one children of the Great Basileus Priamedon, only three survived, for their opponents were adamant in ending the dynasty of Trilios forever - and Hekator is one of them, currently the heir to the throne of Dardanum. Yet, it is no surprise that Priamedon and his family were cursed with such tragedies, for an oracle warned them before the war that an ill destiny was unavoidable for them. That same oracle also predicted that, as long as Hekator should live, Triliax would never fall. While this was interpreted as a promise of invincibility, the truth is that Hekator may instead be the only thing preventing the Divine Citadel from being forever lost to the flames - and nothing guarantees that he will live forever, despite the divine blood of Trilios which flows in his veins. Some tried to convince him that he should stay behind the walls of the palace in security, where he would be sure not to fall, but Hekator is the bravest and noblest warrior of Triliax and never will he abandon his duty, especially since he firmly believes that what makes him special is his unbreakable will to defend his people. Happily, Hekator is also a very talented warrior and general. He his deeply admired by all the people of Triliax, and is believed to be the perfect example of what a Triliaxian ought to be. Although his destiny definitely is as dire as that of the rest of his family, fate also made him a beacon of hope for the nation and a supernatural protector for the whole army he's leading. Thus, Hekator will unknowingly cast Will of the Fates at the start of every battle."

As a result, the High Priests demanded his execution, but Priamedon, having already lost a dear child to such a foretelling, secretly abandoned him on a mountaintop instead. There, Pareas was found and raised by a hermit, and soon his divine blood was betrayed by his outstanding beauty and intelligence. He returned to Triliax and retrieved his royal title, everyone seeing his miraculous survival as a proof that his tragic fate had been averted. When he earned the name of Aleksandros, 'Protector', by saving a nymph from her jealous siblings, he was promised the love of the most beautiful mortal woman in the world, the Queen Helemnestra of Arcoscephale. His sister Cassea warned him that he would cause terrible tragedies if he found her, but he didn't listen and traveled to Arcoscephale, where Helemnestra fell madly in love with him, even though she was married to the king. Together, they left secretly to Triliax, and this became the cause of the war, thus fulfilling the prophecy. Since then, Pareas has been hated as the source of all Triliax's misery. Still, the God protects him behind a veil of illusion, as if the continuation of his dire fate was somehow necessary to the greatness of the City."

As the cursed oracle of Triliax, both loved and hated by the Gods, Cassea-Aleksandra gave warnings about most terrible events that would come to strike her family, often in time to prevent them. But time is not always enough, as convincing people of a painful truth is never easy. Therefore, Cassea often finds herself unable to prevent the future she sees, and she is doomed with loneliness, not only because all her lovers die soon after meeting her, but also because most mortals hate her for being the messenger and therefore the apparent cause of the worst catastrophes. She is called Aleksandra as a reminder of the fact that, having recognized him, she is responsible for the return of her lost brother Pareas-Aleksandros, and thus for the terrible war that crippled the kingdom. She has seen her own death, and already knows that she will suffer greatly in the temple of her own God even before then, but she still faithfully accomplishes her duty as a Great Priestess."

Whereas before the war an oracle warned Priamedon and his family that an ill destiny was unavoidable for them, the true cause of all these disasters is widely believed to be Helemnestra. Originally, she was a simple Arcoscephalian priestess, but one blessed, or actually cursed, with the greatest beauty of any mortal woman. Her charms were so divine, alluring and delightful that countless princes and kings fell in love with her. To prevent the tragedy which was bound to occur from her glamour sowing discord between so many powerful men, the divine-blooded king Agamemnous of Arcoscephale ruled that, whoever the winner, all her suitors would have to pledge they would unite against anyone that would try to break apart her future union. Many did, and in the end she was spoused by King Menelaos, thus becoming queen. But meanwhile, in Triliax, as a reward for his heroic deeds, the prince Pareas-Aleksandros was promised by his God the heart of the most beautiful mortal woman of the world, and he was intent in taking her for himself, even though it was foretold that this would cause a great disaster. When he met Helemnestra in Arcoscephale, she immediately fell in love with him, thus fulfilling the divine promise. Together, they fled to Triliax, and as a result, her husband gathered all her old suitors to uphold their pledge, and this is how the war began. Since then, although in Triliax she is now as hated as she is loved, Helemnestra still hasn't returned home, for she knows that an even worse fate awaits her in her kingdom."

In truth, he never forgave himself for having sacrificed his first daughter to the sea monster and Demi-God Charybdis as was dictated by an older and now almost forgotten foretelling; even though it was required for the survival of the kingdom, he is torn with regrets and now refuses to let fate command him. While he is too old to bear a sword in battle, Priamedon is a talented general as well as the greatest of all mage-priests of Triliax and he will defend his people until his last breath. He is the most direct descendant of Trilios and divine blood courses through his veins, making him almost immortal. Even though he is a great tyrant and will tolerate no disobedience, he still is benevolent in his own way and always keeps in mind the interests of his subjects, for they too are of the holy blood of Trilios."

Cunning enough to blend in with human civilization, manipulate powerful mages and steal their knowledge, each gradually becomes a wizard of terrifying power in either air, astral or nature magic. No-one masters battle magic better than them, so they always have five temporary gems of these elements at their disposal whenever a battle starts. However, being extremely curious of everything, they are very knowledgeable in one other path of magic which is rarer among the birds. They are able to heal their own wounds and by swiftness of both mind and body will avoid most of them. Although they are eccentric free spirits that value originality above all else and typically prefer solitude and seclusion, they are otherwise very charismatic minds that are known for their finesse and their love of Machiavellic pranks."

#descr "Runners are a strange, birdlike breed of predator lizards that can outrun even the fastest of humans. Even though they are able to speak and think, they were always considered primitive, stupid beings by the C'tissians who share their home swamps, barely worth the effort of enslaving them. But recently, the slave prince Ka Rak Kari escaped his jailors and launched a call for the emancipation of all runners. A few more of them escape every day, and most hope to find a new life by joining their audacious prince. Since Runners are distant cousins of the birds, although they are wingless and the targets of the birds' disdain and mockery, Ka Rak Kari answered the universal call of Nephelococcygia and swore allegiance to the Nation of the Birds. While his decision surprised the Republic's leaders, they took it seriously and gave him great authority. For this reason, most freed Runners are now fighting for Nephelococcygia. The Runner Prince Ka Rak Kari is an extraordinary fighter, and has reflexes as swift as the thunder, scales as thick as armor plate, and muscles as strong as a colossus. He is an excellent leader and was granted the powers of a high priest by the God of the Birds, thus proving without the shadow of a doubt that his people has a place in the Republic of the Clouds. He will devoutly serve Nephelococcygia until death, but it would be wisest to ensure his survival, for escaped Runner servants, warriors and shamans will regularly rally to his cause as long as he still lives."

#descr "Born in Isphenople to another great Scholarch, Hyspastia started studying mathematics and astronomy as a child with her father, before spending her adolescence in Arcoscephale to learn metaphysics. When she came back, she was one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of her time. In the span of a few years, aided by her exceptional skills and her immense charisma, she very quickly reached the supreme dignity of a High Scholarch, thus leading one of the most important schools of thought in Isphenople. She is a teacher of great renown, and many come to Isphenople just to listen to her insights in mathematics, metaphysics and astronomy. Also famous for her beauty and her virtue, she despises all that is material and stalwartly rejects the pleasures of the flesh to focus her entire life on the advancement of knowledge. She undoubtedly is one of the most loved and admired personalities of the Scholar Citadel, and should some wrong happen to her, it would be a national tragedy. In addition to being one of the most powerful astral mages of the world, every month Hyspastia has a chance out of five to attract a new disciple. Her disciples are talented philosophers and powerful astral mages that share her great ideas with a few selected students in exchange for a significant fee, thus increasing Isphenople's gold income just like her."

#descr "Ptolaemos is both the greatest living geographer and astronomer of the Scholar Citadel, and by his feats he single-handedly revolutionized its view of the world. Although he was born in Isphenople, he spent over a decade exploring the confines and limits of the Ermorian empire, thus acquiring an incredibly vast amount of knowledge about the world, and data to compile in his works. Although he has written a great number of books, three of them are widely recognized as scientific masterworks, each in a different discipline. The first is the Al'Magistra, a complete treatise of astronomy that explains in great mathematical detail the movements of the planets and the stars around the Earth. The second is the Cosmography, a unified map of the entire known world that also contains important calculations and proofs about the Earth's geometry. The third is the Apotelesmatikum, that speaks of the interactions between the celestial spheres and the material world, and thus systematically identifies the complex astrological causes and effects for a practical use. One of the most brilliant and synthetic minds of our time, Ptolaemos reached the supreme dignity of a High Scholarch with trivial ease, and is now known as the great unifier of earthly and heavenly knowledges. As such, he not only noticeably increases Isphenople's gold income by teaching his discoveries to hundreds of students, but is also a very powerful earth and astral mage, produces one earth gem a month from his geological studies, and will prevent many bad events in the province where he dwells thanks to his astronomical observations."

#descr "A pure mathematician of incomparable genius, Euclideon may be the oldest of all of the Ancient Library's High Scholarchs. As such, he is revered by all, and his theorems carry more authority than almost anything else in the world to Isphenople's savants. As the author of what is probably the greatest book of arithmetic and geometry of all time, called The Elements, it is believed that he has identified most of the Axioms from which our universe is made, and therefore it is entirely sensible to think that no mortal - and perhaps even no immortal - has a better understanding than he of its physical and mathematical laws. His unconditional love of systematic reasoning has inspired scholars in all intellectual disciplines and probably still will centuries from now if the world doesn't end in the Ascension Wars. As a High Scholarch, he leads the most important school of mathematics of Isphenople and increases Isphenople's gold income by teaching to hundreds of students. He is also a skilled engineer, has a great mastery of astral and earth magic, and most importantly, he knows how to extract two astral gems per month from the contemplation of cosmological algebra."

#descr "In the Ancient Library, all branches of knowledge are documented, and while the most theoretical like mathematics and philosophy made Isphenople's fame, the most practical such as sculpture and masonry aren't lacking either. Master Architects use and mix all of these fields, and as such they unsurprisingly are among the most esteemed of Isphenople's erudites; after all, the Library itself is a tremendous masterwork of architecture, and it was built in Isphi, where many ancient C'tissian temples can still be seen. Thus, Master Architects have always held a high place in the nation, and it is of no doubt that they will continue to in the future as well, since the enchanted statues and golden juggernauts they conceive are among the most precious weapons of the Scholar Citadel. Geniuses of engineering that see the laws of physics as a coherent structure, and often leaders of semi-spiritual lodges of alchemists influenced by Gnosticism, most are of arcoscephalian origins but draw their inspiration from very diverse sources, sometimes even the subterranean wonders of the weird people of Agartha. When they come to Isphenople, it is frequent that they are employed in great and important tasks, and they are happy to work for the Scholar Citadel's glory, for they know very well that in no place would their skills both esoteric and mundane be as useful and respected as in the Ancient Library."

It is not merely that the Ancient Library was built in a city where they once reigned. Quite regularly, some unorthodox Sauromancers, maybe even heretics to their kind, come to the Library in order to teach their forgotten secrets, and they are always welcomed and admired by many as fascinating wells of knowledge and wisdom. These mystic scholars speak of what lies Beyond the Veils and are great masters of death and astral magic that know how to extract death gems from the sacred C'tissian sites hidden in Isphenople's lands. They are also powerful augurs and diviners, and no-one in Isphenople questions their priestly authority, for their teachings show an extraordinary understanding of the path ahead of the Conclave and of the Citadel's best interests. Truly, if they aren't Gnostics themselves, then their beliefs are naturally similar."

But like their mistresses the Oreiades, they will answer the call of the Kindly Ones when it is sounded and join the armies of Arcoscephale for half their usual cost; and when appointed as prophets, they reach such an intimate understanding of nature and the human heart that they become able to generate one Nature gem per month."

#descr "Foreign Savants are great erudites that came from far away to learn from the Ancient Library and ended up increasing its knowledge instead. Every month, as long as Isphenople isn't sieged or occupied by barbarians, there is an eight percent chance that a Foreign Savant will join the Scholar Citadel to become a member of the Conclave, and this chance is not affected by any dominion scale. In this state, the Foreign Savant is useless, but he or she can use his or her exceptional manuscript to reveal his or her true identity, thus showing himself or herself as a very powerful priest or mage from another nation or rare independent site."

He is a mystic and erudite of immense skills and is said to be old enough to have seen the times of the Gods with his own eyes. He is mostly known for his incredibly vast writings about the birth of the world and the nature of the gods, and his metaphysical insights probably surpass even those of Arcoscephale's philosophers. Not only does he know the secrets of the stars and all four elements, but he also can inspire researchers in the province where he dwells. Although he is slightly less admired than Ohmeros, he still has a very sacred status even in lands other than Arcadeia, and he is said to have won a poetry tournament against his old rival by singing of the beauty and greatness of peace and friendship. Since he was born on the slopes of Mount Ida, he dedicated his trophy to the benevolent spirits of the Blissful Valley and it can still be seen in a hidden glade to this day."

#descr "Noone knows who Al'Azared was before his conversion. But one day, this Zuna came to Saqaba and with a single word opened the sealed doors of one of the Necropolis' most sacred vaults. The specifics have been lost and mixed with the most unbelievable tales, but it is said that the guards, too astonished to act, fell on their knees before his awe-inspiring presence. Then, he entered the pitch-black vault and stayed there for three days and nights, the most uncanny sounds being heard from beyond the dark this whole time. In the end, all went silent, and only when he left was someone brave enough to arrest and bring him to the Queens. There, he was questionned lengthly, to no avail except incoherent words and maniacal laughs even under torture, so he was left half-dead in a cell to wait for his execution. Yet, next day, he was found on the most populous square of the city, preaching with unequalled eloquence the Awakening God's glory. He also uttered many startling prophecies, several of which have been completed since, and then, he stopped suddenly in screams of undecipherable pain and madness. Some soldiers took that opportunity to catch him, but an eldritch abomination appeared out of thin air and ate them alive before a terrified crowd. Al'Azared was nowhere to be found, and, other than a few unexplained events in the countryside, he apparently had vanished without trace. Almost a year later, he was seen again in Saqaba, seemingly at several places at once, and this time the God was consulted carefully. It was declared that Al'Azared was henceforth to be considered his envoy and that none was to stop him under any circumstance. Since then, his erratic actions overall had a positive impact on Nabatem's most secret goals, especially when he was granted blind trust. Sometimes, monsters that should not be arise to follow him and help the nation. But he is talking of a Falling Star that one day will consume the world, and noone knows how much of an heretic he truly is."

#name "Speaking Meteor"
#descr "Elagabal, the Speaking Meteor, is a baetyl stone that fell from the sky and to Saqaba's desert as a holy messenger of the Awakening God, and that became the Unearthed Queens' counselor in the heart of Saqaba. Its radiance is without equal as it is a black shard of the Sun. It is said that over a century ago, Ermor's emperor at the time, while visiting Saqaba, was so impressed by Elagabal's alien beauty and wisdom that he tried to replace the imperial cult with a new religion of the Sun before being overthrown by the people and replaced by a more orthodox successor. Of cubic shape like the First Baetyl of Nabatem, it shares other similarities with it, such as its supernatural tendency to cause weird incidents to happen around it, or the great influence it exerts over mortal minds. Incidentally, it is one of the most sacred beings in the Lost Necropolis, a living temple that spreads dominion with incredible ease, filling by its mere presence near souls with blind faith and illumination. Furthermore, unlike other baetyls, Elagabal has the ability to speak, which makes it even more remarkable. Although its teachings are sibylline and troubling to researchers, who cannot stop their fascination towards it and thus are being distracted from their goals, they still allow Elagabal to help the nation by their own insights. The Speaking Meteor also seems to be a beacon of power that tends to absorb all magic in the province where it is located and itself radiates with such intensity that its presence alone is unbearable to living beings over long periods of time. Still, it gifts the faithful with a portion of its essence, resulting in the production of one fire, astral and death gems per month."

Her people is proud and always refused to submit to its invaders, such as Machaka, C'tis, Ur and Hinnom. Now, with the Ascension Wars coming, Yau'elkhunu has decided to seal an eternal alliance with Nabatem and fused her kingdom with that of the Onyx Tribe in order to resist their common enemies until the very end. The great proximity of Qudarri culture with that of the Lost Necropolis means that such an absorption can be done quickly and without internal opposition. Henceforth, the nomadic kingdom of Qudar has become a vassal to Nabatem and will serve zealously its protectors. Although Yau'elkhunu is a queen without lands, she still has much to offer to Saqaba. Her people knows the commercial routes through the desert better than any other than the Zunas and will provide Nabatem with a non-negligible gold income for as long as she lives. In addition, she'll always be protected by her harem of faithful colossi bodyguards, and she is a great sorceress of the sands as well as a talented general and a great priestess of the baetylic cult shared by her people and the Amazons."

#name "Ubiquitous Crystal"
#descr "The Ubiquitous Crystal is said to be the very first Astral Megalith and Pillar of Creation, older than time and resting still at the centre of the universe. It takes the shape of a very peculiar megalith, made not of stone but of pure, perfectly translucent crystal whose facets are as straight and polished as a mirror. Its symmetry and regularity appear to be flawless, and it stands so tall and absolutely true towards the sky that it seems impossible that a human or even titanic hand could have originally erected it. Many legends speak of a great crystal tower without door or windows that stands in the middle of some poppy field, mountain vale or salt desert; and many different places, in all imaginable kinds of environment, have been named as the single one where the legendary structure was supposedly located, but none seems to bear any trace of it to this day. This is because the Cosmic Crystal is ubiquitous in nature and located everywhere at once, only manifesting in our timeline whenever it desires so. As such, it is capable both of teleportation and self-duplication and doesn't care for temporal paradox. Although the Ubiquitous Crystal is very similar to Astral Megaliths, it is an incredibly powerful master of astral magic and has the ability to use several magical items at once. In spite of its monolithic nature, it is extraordinarily mobile due to its ability to appear and disappear at will, and the soft music and eerie vibrations that surround it at all times allow it to fascinate or heal living beings - and only them - as well as to attack their minds directly. Although crystal is more fragile than stone, the Ubiquitous Crystal cannot be truly destroyed; as such, even though it has donned the holy mantle of a Pretender God as the Geodetic World-Soul and Karanaac's master, lower incarnations of its own selves can always be summoned or spontaneously appear as the sole yet multitudinous hero of the Awakening, possibly granting it with additional bodies."

#descr "As the direct disciple of one of the greatest philosophers of Arcoscephale, Psatonis wasn't destined to serve the Awakening God of Cyanautha. But when his mentor was assassinated by his rivals, he left the country to ensure both his own survival and that of his master's teachings. Having traveled in many places and each time having pleaded in favor of his philosophy, he finally found a patron in the person of one of the most powerful of Cyanautha's Prytaneis. Since then, he serves him as the wisest counselor of the nation and, using without hesitation his proximity to such a great tyrant, he hopes to achieve the complete practical application of his political philosophy, the greatest work of both his and his master's lives."

#name "Divine Champion"
#descr "Hieraklos, the Divine Champion, is one of the Fifty founding Heroes of Cyanautha and maybe the greatest of them all. Born with divine blood, he always was more than human, and he is gifted with tremendous strength and resilience. When the Telkhines forced Argolinth's inhabitants to accomplish for them so many impossible tasks, Hieraklos was the first to act and completed twelve of them alone all across the world even before the other legendary heroes could be gathered. He then returned to Argolinth in time to join the Fifty and accompany them in their great quest. After the fall of Therodos, like all of the Fifty, Hieraklos was not only blessed with the gift of water breathing, but also rewarded by the God with immortality, and now, centuries later, he has come back to bring glory to the nation. In addition to being a warrior of incomparable skill, Hieraklos is an incredibly charismatic leader and wields a god-killer spear from Mekone that he used in his greatest deeds. He always wears on his head and back the skin of a semi-divine lion he killed with his bare hands as one his twelve tasks, and he is still able today to channel the lion's life force to cast fire and nature spells. But the greatest of his abilities is probably the one he gained when saving a sacred firebird in another of his tasks. Since then, he is constantly protected by the Phoenix's blessing and, unless he loses consciousness, he'll always be reborn from an earth-shaking Pyre when killed during battles, making him almost unstoppable in his heroic fury."

#descr "The Divine Champions of Cyanautha are the Fifty heroes of its legends, the ones that united to face the Telkhines' tyranny, accomplished their impossible challenge and saved Argolinth from impending doom at the Pantokrator's hands. After having done so, they were rewarded with immortality by the God and became semi-divine beings among the stars. Now, with the world on the brink of destruction due to the Wars of Ascension, they have been called down to once more serve the Awakening God in battle, and they'll do so with all their might. They all wear a complete armor of consecrated gold and share all of the Chryselephantine Champions' abilities, often with even more remarkable skill, in particular when it comes to sailing. But each also still possesses his own great powers gained when accomplishing his mythical tasks, either through consuming the essence of the monsters he killed, through wielding the sacred artifacts he found, or through receiving a sacred gift from a mighty supernatural being he saved. As such, all Divine Champions are masters of water and air magic as well as of a third path, and they are always protected by supernatural luck in battle."

#name "Immortal Sorceress"
#descr "Meidae, the Immortal Sorceress, is one of the Fifty founding Heroes of Cyanautha, and is known for her tragic destiny as well as for her great magical powers. Before the fall of Therodos, she was the princess of a foreign kingdom that was a loyal vassal to the Telkhines. But with their rebellion against the Pantokrator, the Telkhines started mistrusting their servants, and they forced the Fifty to accomplish a long series of impossible tasks across the whole world, one of them consisting in stealing the Horn of Abundance from the king whose daughter was Meidae. So they traveled to these far away lands and there, their leader, a great hero known as Jazios, fell in love with the charming girl. But Meidae was more than a simple maiden and was far from naive; she was clever and ambitious, and since her infancy she had learnt the arcane arts in secret from a very ancient and mighty Sauromatian sorceress who considered her her daughter, Kirke the Pharmakeia. Sick of her near-imprisonment as a princess, eager to explore the world, and conscious of her father's foolishness as a servant of the Telkhines, Meidae coldly assassinated her family as asked by Jazios and joined the Fifty in their quest. But by doing so, she brought a terrible curse upon herself and all that she loved. Thanks to her sorcery and her ruse, she helped the Fifty many times during their travels, and she even married Jazios. But when they all returned to Argolinth in order to receive their reward, her fate was already sealed. In a last attempt to stop the heroes, the powerful Telkhine Queen that reigned over the city along with her husband had cast a spell on Jazios and seduced him. Forced to act to prevent the fall of Argolinth, and enraged by the fact that her beloved was weak enough to give away his heart so easily, Meidae killed him with a cloak of burning poison. Since then, unable to end her life due to her immortality, she mourns her loss and teaches her disciples both magic and mistrust of men."

But now, it has finally escaped to the sunlit world, and it is ready to devour mankind in its entirety, should blemmyes cleverly enough direct it far away from them. Expanding at an alarming rate, this unnatural tumor will eventually consume all organic matter in the world unless something is quickly done against it. Every time it grows too large, it duplicates in two separate and independent bodies through mitosis, but make no mistake: there is only one Protozoic Abomination, a single principle behind this whole polymorphic monstrosity. Although the Protozoic Abomination shares most of its abilities with Protozoic Amalgamations, it is obviously much more powerful. Indeed, as long as there exists a Protozoic Abomination somewhere in the world, all existing and future Protozoic Amalgamation commanders will automatically be transformed into duplicates of the Protozoic Abomination itself, thus gaining mastery of Earth and Blood magic as well as the ability to rarely summon more non-commander Protozoic Amalgamations in friendly dominion. Thus, without the intervention of a pretender god, the insatiable illness that is the Protozoic Abomination would never cease to grow and multiply, destroying everything in its wake until the whole universe has been converted into creeping red goo."

#descr "Extraordinarily strange even from a blemmye perspective, Ptyx is a unique creature, the only one of its kind as far as even himself knows. While he should have begun his life as a regular thinking protozoon, since the earliest stages of his development he manifested largely anomalous physical traits. But the most important of his characteristics, which also appeared while he was still very young, is by far his incredibly acute intelligence, much superior to that of any human, let alone sciapod. Thus, armed with incredibly powerful cognitive power, Ptyx quickly overcame all expectations by using clever manipulations to gradually enslave all sciapods who tried to rid him of his freedom. Soon the uncontested master of several ravaged sciapod tribes that took him for a god, Ptyx discovered that this kind of power let him deeply unsatisfied. Completely uninterested in ruling over inferior beings, he soon disappeared without a trace, presumably leaving to ancient places of power or even other planes through magic rituals, and letting the sciapods slowly recover from his domination. There, he amassed a considerable magical expertise and became an extremely powerful Astral and Blood mage, even acquiring the knowledge of how to break the walls between dimensions and teleport at will. But then, he heared about the Awakening God of U and grew curious, for this being had to be as intelligent and mighty as he was. So he came back to U, and soon he understood that even he was no match for a true God. After realizing that as a matter of fact he does like blemmyes for being tasty and worshipping him, he gladly decided to join the Unifier in his sacred war and since then has served him loyally. Although he is an extremely powerful mage of Blood and Stars, he also has many other formidable abilities. In particular, his ethereal body is known for its supernatural regenerative powers, and in addition, he is able to use crowns like Thinking Protozoons and Ioun Foci like Angel Eggs."

That son, Urizen, was the only thing that Mu could claim to truly possess, and as such, he treasured him as the only mind he could teach and embrace without any ulterior motive. For that reason, while Urizen was not truly free, he also was the closest thing there is to Mu's equal and, other than the Pantokrator, the only being that really had some power over Mu. But one day, it was decided by the Pantokrator that Mu and all of his creation had to perish. That day, Urizen was the first to fall, as he faithfully interposed himself between his creator and the All Powerful One, thus fulfilling the only purpose in his life: serving his father. Terribly hurt by the loss of his flesh and blood, Mu was then taken care of, and in his last breath he returned Urizen to eternal life in order to reward him and to one day obtain revenge against his master. Henceforth immortal and undying, Urizen was imprisoned by the Pantokrator and had eons upon eons to think of ways to accomplish his new destiny: causing the Pantokrator's demise. But the Pantokrator that he knew eventually disappeared and was followed by many others in a seemingly unending cycle; slowly becoming mad before that uncomprehensible turn of events, Urizen became but a wandering shadow and suffered until the Awakening God of U proclaimed the imminent rebirth of Mu. Thus, Urizen received a new purpose and joined the Unifier in hope of finally accomplishing his father's will. In addition to being extremely powerful on his own, the Son of Mu will teach the dark arts to all sciapods that desire to help him in his cruel revenge against false gods. As such, up to three Anthropophagoi per month in the same province as him will become Necrophagoi and permanently receive Death magic skills."

#descr "Simultaneously a Sophotatos and a Satrap - and sharing all of the latters' abilities -, Pantagrua is a giant sciapod of prodigious benevolence, skills and intelligence, claimed to be the Wisest of the Wisests. Respected in all of U as a wandering prophet and a herald of the God, he is also blessed with immortality as well as the secret of how to treat any wound and an erudition great enough to inspire new insights to Sophotatoi of all kinds. For decades, he has traveled accross the whole world, learning in the best schools and academies there is, even as far as T'ien Ch'i and Arcoscephale, where he first encountered his human friend Panurgios, who would later reach Magnificient Ind with him before accompanying him to his homeland and becoming a great king. Thus discovering how to distinguish between truth and falsehood, he has developed the holy science of 'Pataphysics to previously unmatched levels. And now that he has returned from his last journey, he will dedicate all of his powers to his beloved nation in the incoming Wars of Ascension."

But Panurgios also was an extremely facetious person and, frankly speaking, a thief and a scammer; almost as much as he loved his animal companions and the joy of partying all night long, he was incapable of resisting temptation when he saw a man too serious and not clever enough to see that he only asked to be tricked. Thus, he was hated by his fellow humans, and when he encountered the giant sciapod wanderer Pantagrua, who loved eating and drinking as much as himself and laughed at the too blind metaphysicians just as he did, a great friendship started and together the two fellows left for new travels without ever looking behind. After many adventures, the two explorers even reached Magnificent Ind, where the legendary Oracle of the Holy Bottle unknowingly gifted Panurgios with a wine so soft and magical that he became nearly immortal and lived for many more decades than a human should have. Eventually, when Pantagrua returned to his mysterious homeland, Panurgios followed him along with his dogs, and there, he proved to be so cunning and generous towards sciapods that he ended up being crowned and became a venerated King on par with even the greatest Gavagais. Now, even though he is rich beyond measure, the ever-lucky Trickster King is getting bored of his royal life and craves for more travels. Whenever he leaves friendly lands for hostile ones, Panurgios changes his apparel from blue to green, his personality remaining the same but his luck nearly shapechanging as he directs it against his enemies. But his very large range of unique abilities should clearly prove useful to the God of U, and he only asks to be of help to his kingdom."

#name "Sciapod General"
#descr "Born particularly stupid and particularly strong, the dreadful Gargamuel is most likely the greatest sciapod warchief that ever lived. Giant, enormous, incredibly brutal, devoid of compassion, and more than anything, extremely voracious, he is a terrifying opponent to have in battle for he eats everyone that he kills. In fact, his appetite is so insatiable that even in times of peace he eats at least five people every day, and, hating them for being too talkative and weak, he sometimes even eats the poor Sophotatoi that are unlucky enough to dwell in the same province as himself; as a result, even whenever he is sleeping - which is basically the only thing he does other than killing and eating -, researchers in his province will always feel nervous and be unusually inefficient. But having the mighty Gargamuel as an ally is clearly worth all of these heavy drawbacks, for in addition to being an exceptional warrior, he also has a very unique ability that his enemies will always envy and fear. Indeed, by demonstrating his unimaginable strength in a nearly divine performance, Gargamuel can either destroy or construct a whole fort with his bare hands in the course of a single month. This feat has two possible effects, both of which require control of the province to be retained until the end of the month. If the province in which it is used contains a fort, that fort will immediately be destroyed, even if enemies are still hiding inside it, but not if they are besieging it. If however that province doesn't contain a fort and if Gargamuel's Titanic Strength hasn't been used there the previous month, a Giant Palisades will be created in exchange for the meager cost of the province not providing any tax income that month. Truly, Gargamuel is an ogre worthy of legends and, as a weapon, a double-edged sword; but in no circumstance he should ever be underestimated."

Each Cherub is thus the nascent symbol and the retroactive manifestation of a disincarnate Tetramorph fated to eventually fully unfold into reality. Cherubim take the shape of cosmic embryos floating in bubbles of golden fire. Even though in this form Tetramorphs are much weaker than when revealing their True splendor Fourfold, Cherubim nonetheless radiate with incomprehensible might and already hold wisdom beyond mortal understanding. Since they are but reflections of their complete selves, they are yet unbound by dimensions. As such, they travel by Will and the Laws of Simultaneity, and the nurturing presence of the Lord's dominion allows them to undo which that is done and to regenerate from afflictions and death alike. When their consciousnesses have grown enough to bloom into full-fledged Tetramorphs, Cherubim undergo Transsubstantiation and lose these two abilities, but in the process unlock their full might."

#descr "The Chayot, living beings, are high servants of the Celestial Sphere. They will only manifest as part of the Merkavah, the Divine Chariot. They serve the Reawakening God as he chose to claim this world as his and proclaim His Glory. The Chayot are surrounded by a blaze of unbearable splendor. At the center of the brilliance stands an angelic being with four wings, four faces and four colors. The Tetramorph have powers over the four cardinal directions and each face beholds all that passes under its domain. The divine might of the Chayot is so vast that it cannot be contained in a singular physical body and only one form of the Tetramorph is manifest at any time. The human faced form of the Chayot has power over the stars and constellations. If harmed it will remanifest as an eagle-faced form with the power of the skies. If this form is harmed, it will transform into a lion-faced being with the power of the sun. Finally, if this form is harmed, it will take an ox-faced form with powers over the earth and mountains. Only then can the Chayot be destroyed. The Chayot will cleanse the souls of any mortal he slays and have them serve his Lord for the remainder of the battle."

#name "Herald of Purity"
#descr "A metaphysical embodiment of the twin divine principles of Justice and Innocence, Dike-Astraea is one of the most sacred beings revered by the Crystal Amazon cult of Purity. In the ancient times she upheld the ban against Blood magic as an immortal spirit of vengeance along with her stepsisters the Erinyes, but like them she disappeared after having completed her sacred task, her innocent half ascending as a young star in the Celestial Spheres while her vengeful half descended to the Underworld to torment for eternity the souls of those she had slain. And now, with the Wars of Ascension's beginning, she can once more be called down and her two faces united to accomplish her holy mission and relentlessly hunt down Blood mages in the name of Purity. Unlike her sister the Herald of Necessity, Dike-Astraea will uncompromisingly punish all who dare to make use of the unholy arts, even her own sibling if she too was summoned. As such, for as long as she is alive, her dark half Dike will track down and smite all Blood mages in Thalamanth one after the other, spelling Death to profanators and only sparing pretender gods in her killing spree. Meanwhile, her light half Astraea will serve the God with her entire might, bringing hope and confidence to the faithful and gifting them with three immaculate Air gems per month. The Herald of Purity also holds great physical and magical might. Her hair is full of poisonous serpents, her breath is unbearable and she strikes both fear and awe in the hearts of mortals. Her skills as an assassin are unsurpassed, and while unlike her sisters she doesn't bring darkness along with her, she instead is protected at all times by a Soul Vortex and a veil of invisibility. Since her immense priestly authority and powers over Death and the Stars are strictly directed towards the destruction of corruption, she will almost never pause to cast lengthy rituals or forge items, except to convoke the Erinyes or follow the hidden paths of the Underworld."

#name "Herald of Necessity"
#descr "A metaphysical embodiment of the divine forces of Fate and Destiny, the Herald of Necessity is one of the most sacred beings revered by the Crystal Amazon cult of Purity. In the ancient times she upheld the ban against Blood magic as an immortal spirit of vengeance along with her stepsisters the Erinyes, but now, with the Wars of Ascension's beginning, she has changed more than anyone could suspect. She has indeed come to the dreadful conclusion that the Amazons must fully embrace Blood magic to further their sacred mission and ensure the reign of Purity upon the world. Although her terrible word hasn't spread yet in Thalamanth and has been until now kept an esoteric secret by the Pythias, who remain entirely faithful to their unforgiving ideals and still violently reject such a radical thought as madness and heresy, some serious discussions about this matter are already starting to be held in their highest circles, and should the Herald of Necessity either be ritually brought back to the world or don the holy mantle of Thalamanth's pretender god, all of the Crystal Tribe would be forced to submit to her sacred utterances and to accept her inescapable logic in the name of the Greater Good and absolute Necessity. As a result, for as long as the Herald is awake and alive, blood hunting no longer will cause any sacred being to desert; however, her disturbing presence and ideology will also trigger a great wave of discord within the kingdom, and as such will cause all provinces in friendly dominion to gain nine units of unrest every month. In addition, the Herald of Necessity holds great physical and magical might. Her hair is full of poisonous serpents, her breath is unbearable and she strikes both fear and awe in the hearts of mortals. She is at all times followed by darkness and she brings bloody justice wherever her crimson wings carry her. She has vast skills in Air, Astral and Blood magic, and if she isn't a pretender will also bear immense priestly authority."

#name "Undying God"
#descr "An Undying God is the disincarnate wraith of a deity strong enough to break the laws of the Underworld and reascend to the world of the living much earlier than they demand. Although reaching such a state for sure allows a pretender to avoid most of the limitations of matter and even death itself, it also makes them abominable to the world and forces upon them the continuous effect of an ever-growing horror mark until they truly die and return under a more natural form. Furthermore, while in this tortured form the Undying God will endure intolerable suffering which will most likely translate into uncontrollable displays of madness, and a very powerful aura of death will emanate from them, thus killing hundreds every month in the province where they are located."

#name "Soul of the Flocks"
#descr "The Soul of the Flocks is a primordial spirit as old as avian kind itself, whose essence is intimately connected to birdkin, just as birdkin is intimately connected to it. A living mystery in and of itself, it escapes all definitions for it is something different to each individual bird, a slightly different echo in each birdsong, the fickle harmony resulting from birdkind's chorus. As a result, no one truly understands what she is, and yet all who know of her remember these words: she is the Goddess Who Believes She Is A Flock of Birds; and all the same, she is but a Flock Of Birds Who Believes It Is A Goddess. She who is an illusion is also the truth behind all the gods; or so believe the birds, who each worship a difference aspect of the Goddess, another of her ten thousand faces, and through their belief let her be and rule their republic, and through their song let her emerge and orchestrate their symphony.  In the past, she served the Pantokrator as an incorporeal expansion of his will, embodying the collective consciousness of the birds as his celestial servants and messengers and speaking for their entire kin in the whispers of the wind and in the shine of their feathers; but now, with the Pantokrator gone, she has at last broken free from her long servitude and has come to spread her wings as a Pretender God. The Soul of the Flocks is a very powerful entity and possesses two unique abilities thanks to her extraordinary influence on birds; the first one allows her to spend the month creating twelve new birds of gold out of her own radiance, at will, while the second one causes her to automatically bless all friendly animals at the start of every battle she takes a part in, even if they aren't sacred."

Some claim that he was a forgotten Gigante of incredible power, others that he was the Titanic father of all Gigantes, and still others yet that he came to birth only when the Phlegran Gigantes were imprisoned, as the living embodiment of the Laestrygonian curse. Regardless of the truth, he is by far the most powerful of all Laestrygonians, so powerful in fact that he has already cannibalized several of them while sleeping underneath the earth, every time unknowingly causing terrible disasters to wreak havoc on the surface. As indifferent to mortals' faith and well-being as a child to the happiness and beliefs of ants, the Laestrygonian Devourer wishes to bring destruction to the cosmos more than anything else and has naturally donned the holy mantle of a pretender god when trembling insects started worshiping him in the vain hope that he would spare them. The Laestrygonian Devourer will always start the War of Ascension imprisoned, but woe to the world should he ever awaken, for he might very well annihilate everything in his wake."

After many conquests in which he vanquished enormous armies with very small means, he was recognized as a living God, capable of winning against all odds, building an empire spanning entire continents and centuries, and forever changing the face of the world. Prophetized to become the very emperor of mankind as a whole, he is now the center of the Hero Cult, the first of the Immortals and the model for all Makedonian Heroes. As such, he has donned the holy mantle of a pretender god, and he will now protect his troops by seemingly twisting fate itself with his unequalled charisma and understanding of the art of war, thus automatically casting Will of the Fates at the start of every battle."

#name "Renascent Evil"
#descr "For many hundreds of years, the Zunnites have been cursed with a prophecy that cyclically comes true every century. Each time, the moon of Zun becomes scarlet like blood and a single male is born from a Garnet Amazon - the only circumstance under which this can happen. This male is the chosen one of a dark god that was banished eons ago by the Pantokrator, and his body bears the marks of his great destiny: an olive skin, golden eyes, hair like fire and inhuman strength and cruelty. This semi-divine being is a living paradox, for he is both the Zunnites' mortal enemy and a tyrant promised to lead them to incomparable glory, should the Amazons fail to destroy him. In the past, although he has occasionally brought unimaginable chaos to the kingdom, and although dealing with him has never been easy, he has most of the time been murdered in his infancy when he was at his weakest; but now, with the world nearing its end in the Ascension War, the prophecy is reaching its conclusion and the Amazons have surrendered to the Renascent Evil's strength, in the hope that he would spare them and bring final victory to the realm. Even though the Renascent Evil can be chosen by Zun as its Pretender God, he can also be summoned and resurrected any number of times with a highly advanced Blood magic ritual. While in his divine form he is a master of Fire, Earth, Death and Blood magic, as an unholy champion he is entirely unable to cast spells. Still, he is permanently protected by a very powerful magic and unfathomable obscurity clouds the entire region where he is located. He will also attract three horrible monsters every month, and as a warrior he is extremely difficult to defeat or escape. He most likely is his own worst enemy, for in his madness he will often act against the kingdom's interests, slaughter the civilian population of the province where he dwells or spread despair, unrest and heresy at an incredibly fast rate."

With the Pantokrator gone, its powers are unleashed and war and justice for the Amazons have once more come to the world. Many Amazon warriors of the Garnet Tribe gather in the land of the statue either to wreak havoc and plunder or to bring it under a strict rule. Depending on the scales in the province, more Amazons will arrive: Garnet Hoplites in high order and Garnet Furies in high turmoil. More will come in a high dominion. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."

From her jeweled throne in the heart of the temple-city, she governs her kingdom with supreme authority and orders her vast armies the conquest and enslavement of the weak. For centuries, she has acquired more and more power, ensuring her eternal youth through the use of powerful Blood magic rituals, and now her desire to hold the whole world in her grasp has led her to don the holy mantle of a Pretender God. As the perfect representative of all Amazonkind, she is worshipped by her people and believed to be the one who will bring to fruition the dream of all Zunnites: the complete subjugation of men and the coming of absolute Justice upon the world. In addition to being a very powerful mage, she is in possession of a secret weapon of great strength that she spent many years preparing for the upcoming war: royal studs where purebred drakons are raised and their elite sacred riders trained. As a result, she will create a Purebred Drakon Stud in the capital after spending a whole month there, thus unlocking the early recruitment of powerful Drakon Cavalry and Drakon Knights. Although this national site can also be summoned in wastelands and caves independently of Zun's pretender, only the Garnet Queen and the Arch Salamander are capable of making use of it right away, which is in and of itself an advantage to be reckoned with."

#descr "The Forgotten Queen of Elemental Fire is the supreme physical manifestation of the wild magic of Fire. Only three Fire Royalties are known to exist to mortals, but that's because a previous Pantokrator punished the last and the most powerful of them for all eternity, and with time she became forgotten by all but the most ancient beings. With the Pantokrator gone, the Fourth Fire Royalty is feeling her shackles weakening and will soon be able to release herself from her otherworldly prison. She has thus donned a godly mantle and taken the role of a Pretender God, eager to subsume all elements under the dominion of Fire. The Forgotten Queen of Fire has a body of flames and sulphur and appears as a huge, crowned female being. She is innately skilled in Fire magic and is constantly surrounded by a very powerful fire shield. She is entirely unable to enter underwater provinces, even with the help of magic. In addition to being extremely powerful on her own, she will create a raging fire elemental servant every month out of nothingness, and as the mother of most of the Elemental Bastard-Princesses of Zun, she is able to summon them earlier and at a largely reduced cost."

#name "Divine Heroine"
#descr "It is said that in the early days of Zun, as a semi-divine being of terrifying power and purpose called the Renascent Evil had succeeded in vanquishing the Vestals and becoming their black monarch, seven legendary Amazon heroines united their forces to defeat him and end his dark reign. These sacred warriors were armed with supernatural weapons bestowed by the gods and thanks to their immense courage they stroke the Evil down from his throne for the first time. Although the Renascent Evil was promised by a prophecy to come back every century to once again attempt to bring Zun under his tyrannical dominion and lead it to glory, and although the Seven Heroines all died before his return, their marvelous deeds and decisive victory inspired the Amazons with an unbreakable will to fight back - which allowed them to never again be entirely defeated -, and they are still celebrated to this day during several festivities all across the Zunnite calendar. In honor of these heroines, seven monumental statues were carved from the stone of the desert, where they were tasked with eternally watching over the kingdom. But centuries have passed, and today, all but one of them are lost, either fallen in ruins or resting in forgotten places as a mysterious reminder of a long gone past. The only one remaining is the statue of the Divine Heroine, the leader and the first of the Seven, an Amazon so great in every way that she has ascended as the protector-Goddess of Zun, a patron of war and wisdom and a bringer of good fortune. Guiding the Amazons of the Garnet Tribe through the Vestals' divinings, she has foreseen the Pantokrator's disappearance and remained hidden from the rest of the world until now. But with her prophecy finally coming true, she has now donned the holy mantle of a Pretender God and promised to return to reorder the world under the rule of Justice, though localizing her statue in the middle of the desert might take some time even with her guidance."

#name "Lord of the Dry Sea"
#descr "The Lord of the Dry Sea is a fallen demigod sprung from the depths of a now long dead sea. He was given power over that sea by a previous Pantokrator and made it a flourishing kingdom. Having bestowed men with too many gifts, they began to worship him as though he was a God. The Pantokrator was furious and punished his servant, banishing him for all eternity and destroying his work by condemning his sea to dry out and disappear forever, replaced by the most arid of salt deserts. Now that the Pantokrator is gone, the King of Salt is free to exact his revenge by drying out all other oceans as his was and will receive the prayers and sacrifices of men in exchange for sparing them. The Lord of the Dry Sea can leave the ocean and grant humans the ability to breathe underwater. Although he spreads death in the province where he dwells and is weakened in all magic paths, especially water, he still is a very powerful mage and can bless his followers with the aspects of Fire, Water, Earth and Death, as well as gift them with magical gems of each of these paths formed under the salt crust of his desert."

#name "Lord of the Red Forest"
#descr "The Lord of the Red Forest is a fallen giant of divine heritage once given dominion over fertility by a previous Pantokrator. He inseminated the land so well that his empire of lush forests and wild beasts conquered all the dry parts of the world and broke the Pantokrator's edict that shared the lands between forests and deserts. Furious, the Pantokrator punished his servant by corrupting his work. His woods were changed into red stone, his beasts into giant and ravaging insects, and almost all that remained was burnt to the ground by unstoppable fires. In the end, the Lord of the Red Forest himself was imprisoned underneath the earth to be eaten alive by red ants for all eternity, and the only thing that remained of him in the outside world was a mysterious forest of red trees that resisted the harsh climates of his now dried lands, explaining his current name. But now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Lord of the Red Forest has found a way out of his prison underneath to enact his vengeance upon the world. Having recovered control over his corrupted nature, he has legions of insects as his allies; but now sterile and full of spite and hatred for the wild greenery that no longer follows him, he has decided to burn down all other woodlands and to extend his enigmatic red forests over the whole world. Still affected by his old master's curse, the Lord of the Red Forest will encounter tragic events everywhere he goes; but his wrath has made him into a very powerful mage, and his poisoned gifts to the faithful can be used as magical gems of fire, earth and mostly nature."

#name "Arch Salamander"
#descr "The Arch Salamander is a huge red Drakon attuned to fire and the earth that hates water and loves the hot and dry climate of wastelands and volcanoes. The Drakones are ancient many-headed reptiles of tremendous power. Born outside of this world, the Drakones were once summoned and used by a previous Pantokrator as punishment when he found his servants lacking in faith. The Drakones brought destruction upon nations and soon the very world was at risk. The Pantokrator decided to imprison the Drakones for millennia. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening. Drakones are enormous, scaly beasts generally capable of breathing poisonous gas upon enemies, but unlike most of its kin, the Arch Salamander instead breathes fire. Drakones are wingless and do not have the ability to change shape. Some Arcoscephalean historians claim that they are progenitors or a primitive form of the great dragons, and it is also widely believed that the Arch Salamander fathered the salamanders from Abysia. In addition to being a monster of great might, as the original progenitor of all Zunnite drakons, the Arch Salamander is able to birth many more of these destructive creatures. As a result, he will create a Purebred Drakon Stud in the capital after spending a whole month there, thus unlocking the early recruitment of powerful Drakon Cavalry and Drakon Knights. Although this national site can also be summoned in wastelands and caves independently of Zun's pretender, only the Arch Salamander and the Garnet Queen are capable of making use of it right away, which is in and of itself an advantage to be reckoned with. Due to his deep distate of water, the Arch Salamander is entirely unable to enter underwater provinces or to cross rivers, even in winter and even with the help of magic."

#name "Prime Vessel"
#fixedname "Baghal-Syr"
#descr "The Prime Vessel is a very antiquated sentient alchemical creation and a truly immortal artificial living being of great power, the first and the greatest of all Blood Vessels as conceived by the Garnet Sorceresses of another time. Shaped from the divine blood of a dying God, it is much more powerful than other Blood Vessels and through the centuries has acquired immense knowledge of Blood magic, until it reached the dream of all blood mages and became able to create life out of nothingess. When the Pantokrator heard about this abomination and its odious crime against his Divine Edicts, he was furious and he imprisoned the Prime Vessel for all eternity, thus deprieving the Garnet Amazons of their main source of sustenance. Since then, the Amazons have found other, lesser ways to fulfill their needs, but now, with the Pantokrator gone, the Prime Vessel has escaped from its prison and has decided to use its incredibly vast powers to claim godhood and don the holy mantle of a Pretender God. With a body entirely made of living ichor, it can take many forms but usually chooses the shape of a female being of great beauty. The horrendous fluid it is made of is perpetually self-rejuvenating, and its repugnant tendrils are able to suck the lifeforce out of its victims, making of the Prime Vessel a formidable and very dangerous foe. But the most incredible of the Prime Vessel's powers is by far its ability to create life out of nothingness, both in the form of a permanent generation of Blood slaves and of a wondrous garden of artificial life called the Magnum Opus, that the Prime Vessel uses for its experiments. Thus, after spending a whole month in the capital, the Prime Vessel will recreate the Magnum Opus and permanently increase growth scales in Zun's dominion by three levels. Finally, thanks to its link with the mysterious Clone Sorceresses, the Prime Vessel is able to awaken them for a reduced cost in both slaves and research."

#name "Rock of Ages"
#descr "The Rock of Ages is a colossal boulder of divine stature and unimaginable weight. Centuries ago, the first philosophers of Arcoscephale already discussed unsolvable paradoxes. On the verge of complete madness due to his inability to find a satisfying answer to one of them, after having traveled accross the whole world in a vain search for the truth, one of these ancient thinkers dared to ask the Pantokrator directly for a solution. Thus, he challenged the All-Powerful One to create a stone so heavy that even he couldn't lift it. Annoyed by that little human's impudence, the Great One amalgamated in a single point the mass of a thousand stars, and thus shaped the Rock of Ages, a force so irresistible that its mere existence defied his own laws. But then, forced to face the impossibility to lift that stone he created without admitting his inability to fulfill the sophist's request, the Pantokrator felt tricked, and, full of wrath and embarassment, he decided to imprison it for all eternity to hide his failure, and punished the imprudent mortal by forcing him to make the Divine Boulder roll up a hill only for it to roll down when it neared the top, in an endless, self-repeating cycle of suffering. But recently, with the Pantokrator gone, the old man has been released from his unending pain by death, and soon the Rock of Ages won't be retained anymore by its prison. As the embodiment of unstoppable strength and absolute hardness, in spite of its imprisonment, the Rock of Ages has been living in the legends of mortals and has fascinated them enough to come to be worshipped by them. Countless offerings later, it has become sentient and will now don the holy mantle of a Pretender God. Due to its impenetrable mind, the Divine Boulder is entirely unable to use magic, but it is almost impossible to survive its attacks or to destroy it, and it is so heavy that its mere presence exhausts enemies in its vicinity as per the Curse of Stones battle spell."

Thrice blessed by the previous Pantokrator it became his herald, warrior and general when he brought order to the world. When the work of the Pantokrator was finished he imprisoned and banished all that threatened his creation and the Golden Boar was deemed too unruly to remain in Creation. The Crested Boar was forever imprisoned in the forest of the Horned One where he found an ally with a temperament resembling his own. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Thrice Horned Boar of War is breaking free to lead his followers in peace and war. A crest of bristles, golden skin and three horns on the forehead sets the Thrice Horned Boar apart as a divine being with powers far surpassing the monstrous boars that sometimes appear in the lands of men.

#descr "The Kami of the Sun is the daughter of the previous Pantokrator. Together with her two brothers she was brought into existence when the Pantokrator grieved after banishing his wife to the netherworld. When he wiped his left eye a divine spark was set free and hastened to the heavens. Watching the spark he called it daughter. She reminded him of his banished wife and he endowed her with the brilliance and beauty of the sun. But when the people of the world started to worship her instead of him he got jealous and imprisoned her in a cave for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Kami of the Sun is returning to the world to bring joy and prosperity to mankind. She shines with blinding light and beauty, and she is so magically powerful that she starts every battle with a temporary gem of fire and produces more every month."

Together with his brother and sister he was brought into existence when the Pantokrator grieved after banishing his wife to the netherworld. When he blew his nose a divine breath was set free and hastened to the heavens. Watching the breath he hesitated to call it son. After giving his daughter the mandate of the sun and his first son the mandate of the moon, the Pantokrator no longer felt obliged to grant a celestial mandate to his snot-born child. Instead he gave it the mandate of the storms and the sea. Infuriated the third child of the Pantokrator rebelled and caused destruction and disorder wherever he went. With rising ire the Pantokrator watched the misdeeds of his unwanted son and finally imprisoned him for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Kami of Storms is breaking free to once more wreak havoc upon the world. As a warrior of unparalleled skills, he is permanently quickened, almost tireless and capable of avoiding most wounds, and as a very magically powerful being, he starts every battle with a temporary gem of air and produces more every month."

#descr "The Dharmapalas were giants of divine heritage tasked by a previous Pantokrator with upholding the celestial laws. The Dharmapala of the Underworld was given mandate over the laws of death and rebirth. He took the Throne of the Underworld and made himself judge and ruler of the dead. His demonic servants guided the dead to their next life. But with time his mind darkened, and he was seduced by jealousy and hunger for power. He demanded prayers from men in return for a good afterlife. His judgment lost righteousness and his servant demons wrongfully led the newly dead to the hellish realm of the Dharmapala. When the Pantokrator realized that his most trusted servant had broken the laws of death and rebirth to collect the prayers of men he was furious and imprisoned the Dharmapala in this world, disconnected from the Hell he had created. Now with the Pantokrator gone the Dharmapala is free to once more judge the dead as he sees fit. As a judge of the fate of men, he can return harm his enemies inflict him against them, and he is so magically powerful that he starts every battle with a temporary gem of death and produce more every month."

She became a huntress of primordial beasts and was entrusted by a previous Pantokrator to care for the wilderness. He gave her a golden bow and authority over the crescent moon as well as the animals of the wild, beasts and birds alike. But mankind began to make offerings to the Huntress and she let herself be worshipped and promised mankind that she would protect the huntsmen and the unmarried women of the world. The Pantokrator sent his servants to punish her for her breach of trust, but she transformed herself into a deer and escaped into the First Forest. Here she met another of the Pantokrator's servants and he gave her hounds to help her in the Hunt. The Pantokrator was furious and trapped them both in the forest for eternity. Now with the Pantokrator gone the paths of the First Forest are once more open and the Titan of the Hunt and the Moon can once more hear the prayers of young women and huntsmen. With primordial monsters emerging anew the Titan of the Hunt and the Moon has taken it upon herself to rid the world of monsters and claim the world as hers. The Titan of the Hunt and the Moon is always accompanied by her sacred hounds as well as animals of the wild, and her great deeds inspire the people ways to defend themselves in times of war and to remain serene in times of peace."

The Graeae, while not nearly as powerful as their father, were imprisoned and chained in a stygian cavern as a precaution. For millennia the crones have waited, getting older and angrier for every year that passed. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening and their malice can be felt by those who dream. The Grey Ones are incredibly old and their bodies are frail and weak. Two of the sisters have lost their eyesight and now the three of them share a single eye. All three sisters use death and water magic, but they have all mastered different magical paths. The first of the Sisters, 'the Terrible', uses blood and nature magic. The second sister, known as 'the Warlike' uses fire and earth magic and the third sister, 'the Destroyer' uses air and astral magic.

#descr "The Titan of Growth is a giant of divine heritage born in primordial times. She was once given power over all things growing by a previous Pantokrator. Her blessings and gifts to mankind were numerous and she brought fertility and life to the world. When her daughter was abducted by the Great Adversary she was devastated and abandoned her tasks and all life withered and died. The Pantokrator was furious, imprisoned her for eternity and gave the dominion of growth to a better suited candidate. Now with the Pantokrator gone, the Titan of Growth can return to the world and reclaim her former glory and possibly find her missing daughter. Powerful nature spirits she mothered in the ancient times, called Oreiades, shall come to her every spring and help her in her divine task unless she is hiding or imprisoned in a fort under siege."

By removing her viscera and hiding it outside her body, she is virtually impossible to slay. Should the body be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Lich Queen lacks the Arch Mage's broad base of magical knowledge, but her reanimated body is more durable than a living body since it is leathery and dry and lacks all organs of importance."

As soon as the Titans came into being, she was no longer of any use to the Pantokrator, and he imprisoned her in a box that contained all the evils of the world, so that she could shine in the most utter darkness and so that only he could secretly contemplate her beauty. But now, the Pantokrator is gone, the box has opened, and the evils it contained have broken loose upon the abandoned world. Thus, the Primeval Spirit of Dawn has decided to once again bring order, harmony and purity to the world, and has donned the holy mantle of a Pretender God."

While it is true that he has roamed the skies for millenia, bringing life, magic and miracles to wherever he passed, he also always was considered a truly rare and magnificent sight to behold. As it is rumored that wonders appear in places where he stops to rest, adventurers of all kingdoms dream of finding his nest or capturing him, but the Rainbow Bird seems to be almost impossible to catch, even by the eyes alone. In recent centuries, afraid of the power a mortal might gain by keeping the Rainbow Bird's supernatural light for himself, the Pantokrator hid him and took his freedom. But now that the Pantokrator is gone, the Rainbow Bird will soon be able to escape the shadows and shine upon the world like a second sun. He gifts his faithful people with marvels, and each month he will create one magic gem of each of the seven colors of the rainbow."

She has thus donned a godly mantle and taken the role of a Pretender God, eager to subsume all elements under the dominion of Air. The Forgotten Queen of Air has a body composed of dark, billowing clouds and appears as a huge, crowned female being with four arms. She is innately skilled in Air magic and, her body being composed of clouds and mist, she is very difficult to harm. She is entirely unable to enter water, even with the help of magic. Just like the other Queens of Air, although she cannot wear the Amazon Jewels, she is able to draw incredible power from the Regalia of the Sky, a crown and a blade that symbolize the Queens' authority. In addition, she will automatically cast Mistform at the start of every battle."

But searching for purity in the hearts of mortals, he found the Crystal Tribe Amazons, taught them the ways of virtue and justice, was recognized by them as their most sacred guide, and finally gave birth to the three Demi-Gods of the Sky, thus angering the Pantokrator, who bound the spirit in a huge stone statue for eternity. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshipped as a reawakening god. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back. And yet, its most marvelous power doesn't reside in its physical shape, but in the greatest of its secrets; for it knows better than anyone how to contact back his three sons and start the Crystal Crusade. Thus, he is the only being capable of summoning the Demi-Gods of the Sky without any research and to unlock the recruitment of Thalamanth's highest leaders, the Thunder Priestesses and their zealous Thunder Guards. In addition, he can do so for a greatly reduced cost."

As soon as he was free to roam the world, he did so in search of purity within mortals' hearts, and he finally settled close to the lands of the Crystal Tribe Amazons to teach them the ways of virtue and justice. Since then, he has always been revered by them as their most sacred guide as well as the father of all pegasi. But then, he also gave birth to the three Demi-Gods of the Sky, and, furious, the Pantokrator stripped him of his liberty for all eternity, spelling doom upon the Amazons. And yet, eventually the Pantokrator disappeared and with him the shackles that maintained the Celestial Pegasus out of this world. Now, he will release himself from his prison and take the holy mantle of a pretender god. In addition to being physically and magically very powerful, the Celestial Pegasus also heightens the hearts of all amazons and pegasi by his mere presence. As soon as he is awake and as long as he walks among the living, he'll increase order in the province where he is located. In addition, each month, all Amazon temples under his dominion will have fifty percent chance to attract a new Wind Maiden for free, plus an additional fifty percent per Order scale, culminating at two guaranteed Wind Maidens per month when the order in the province is at its maximum."

He reigned supreme over the Kingdom of the Clouds, and roamed it freely as the most sacred and humble of its guardians. But as the progenitor of all horses, he came to be worshipped by the like-mindedly free-spirited people of the Horse Tribe, and he created the three Demi-Gods of the Sky to protect them. Thus, furious, the Pantokrator revoked his powers and imprisoned him for all eternity. Since then, keeping his dear memory alive, his followers among the Horse Tribe renamed themselves the Wind Tribe and joined the Crystal Tribe Amazons as instructed by their Demi-God guides. More recently, the Cloud Sages were revealed by the Clouds that his imprisonmnent would soon come to an end, and indeed, eventually the Pantokrator disappeared and with him the shackles that maintained the Brother of the Clouds out of this world. Now that all his followers have uncompromisingly united under his watch, he will release himself from his prison and take the holy mantle of a pretender god to spell the rule of absolute freedom upon the entire world. In addition to being physically and magically very powerful, he inspires the Wind Tribe in his wake, thus attracting three horsemen per month, but like all air elementals, he is entirely unable to enter water, even with the help of magic.

#name "King of the Clouds"
#descr "The King of the Clouds is a powerful primordial cloud-spirit that takes the vague shape of an august lion and was given dominion over the Kingdom of the Clouds by a previous Pantokrator. But the King of the Clouds gave birth to the elemental Queens of Air and was punished with eternal imprisonment. Since then, he has carefully prepared his return and acquired the veneration of mortals by teaching air magic to those mighty enough to contact him through the Veils of this world. And now, with the Pantokrator gone, ready to free himself and reign both over the skies and all that resides below, he has finally taken the holy mantle of a pretender god. He floats with serene grace over a wondrous place called the Throne of the Clouds, that moves alongside him whenever the winds lead him to new skies, and he never flies away from his palace of gentle mist. As such, although he is not truly immobile and can both slowly change position during battles and use rituals such as Cloud Trapeze, he still cannot leave his current province without the help of magic. In addition, just like other air elementals, he is entirely unable to go underwater, even through magical means. In exchange, although he is physically vulnerable, he has vast powers over both air and water, and he is incredibly hard to destroy thanks to the near-immateriality of his self-reforming essence. Furthermore, he is constantly surrounded by glacial winds, will automatically cast Mistform at the start of every battle and can swallow whole anyone that comes too close to him without addressing him with due deference."

Created by a previous Pantokrator as a divine mount worthy of the Omnipotent One, he served him faithfully until his eventual disappearance. Other deities then attempted to seize him as his new masters, but he appeared untameable even by the Gods and in the end another Pantokrator, furious against his indocility, imprisoned him below the sea, where he became one with it. Since then, the very tide has become his mane and he has again defied the Pantokrator's edicts by protecting the blood of Trilios against his wrath. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the indomitable Steed of the Sea can feel his prison weakening, and soon he will lead the great nation of Dardanum to supreme glory as its pretender god. As the father of Trilios' sacred Horses, he will attract more of them when in strong dominion and several will accompany him at all times to crush his enemies."

#descr "The Father-Tree is the progenitor of all Sky Trees, and one of the most ancient sentient trees of the world. When the world was still young and the Pantokrator or one of his lieutenants first created the birds, they quickly found a home in his foliage and he fell in love with their kind. Since then, unlike his brothers, he has always been a protector of the birds rather than of plants or nature as a whole, and he passed down this trait to his descendants. As such, even though he is a powerful nature mage, it is about the element of air that he knows the most. Recently, when the birds united to build their nation and steal divinity from the gods, sensing that their hour had come, the Father-Tree naturally supported them and selflessly became the holy symbol of their aspirations, their Pretender God. Like his progeny, he is frailer than most sentient trees but he is the living home of entire flocks of birds who serve and defend him in all circumstances. As the creator of all Sky Seeds, he is also able to produce one air and nature gem each month. With ancient wisdom comes great age, and he is likely to fall sick unless the strength of his nature magic protects him."

Cunning enough to blend into human civilizations, manipulate powerful mages and steal their knowledge, it has gradually become the greatest of all Bird Sorcerers and has learned how to take a human form to perform rituals involving the use or creation of magical items. No-one masters air, astral or nature battle magic better than the Feathered Wizard, so it will always have five temporary gems of these elements at its disposal whenever a battle starts. However, it is very knowledgeable in other paths of magic as well. In its bird form it is able to heal its own wounds and by swiftness of both mind and body will avoid most of them. Having mastered its own mortality, it has donned a godly mantle and taken the role of a Pretender God."

As the matron of arts and creation, she will gift her people with sacred inspiration in the form of two Air gems and two Nature gems per month. While much more potent than the Astral Muses of Arcoscephale, each of which is the patron of only one art, the Great Muse has willingly chosen to thread the earth along with her cherished mortal children; as such, she doesn't share her younger sisters' connection with heavens. Loving of mankind as long as it is respectful of art, beauty and their roaming spirits, the Great Muse was worshipped for a very long time by simple pastoral poets as the immaculate wings of imagination and harmony; and knowing of the emergence of dangerous new Gods that threaten her people and the stability of nature, she is now ready to don the holy mantle of a Pretender God and let every living soul contemplate her naked glory and the nobility of her aspirations."

As the ideal nymph, the Pleiad will frequently attract Epimeliad followers that will serve her with their elemental and natural magic, their priestly powers, and their ability to increase sloth and another positive scale in the province where they roam. There are four different types of Epimeliad, and one of each will have an independent twenty percent chance of joining the Pleiad every month while she is awake. In the past, the Pleiad never let her spark leave the night sky, and she didn't interfere with mortal lives. But now, with the departure of the Pantokrator and the coming of dangerous new Gods, she is ready to defend those that revere nymphs and the sky's purity and to lead them by donning the holy mantle of a Pretender God."

It is even said that he is the one who conceived and built the immense, antediluvian Gates that are lost in the forests of Mount Ida.

Through dark rituals, she succeeded in mastering one of mankind's oldest and most urgent goals, to defeat death. By removing her viscera and hiding it outside her body, she is virtually impossible to slay. Should the body be physically destroyed, a new one is formed from the dust of dead humans. Being immortal, there is nothing left to acquire but godhood. The Queen of Queens lacks the Arch Mage's broad base of magical knowledge, but her reanimated body is more durable than a living body since it is leathery and dry and lacks all organs of importance."

Its massive and almost perfectly cubic stone is blacker than any other, and in the everchanging reflections of its glass-like surface, maddening mysteries can be glimpsed. An eerie aura surrounds it at all times and seems to constantly cause inexplicable events, in particular hysterical fear and frenzy in the hearts of animals and an uncontrollable obsession for the cubic shape in the minds of spiritually receptive men. Thus, it was inevitable that the Baetyl would come to be worshipped, and now, it has gained enough power to don the holy mantle of a Pretender God. Although it is immobile and eternally silent, which means that it won't help its followers in their magical research or direct them in their battles, it is almost indestructible in its dominion and it radiates with unequalled magical power."

As a psychopomp deity, his task was to lead the dead to the afterlife Below the Waves and to guide the living away from it. He was the father of giants as well as the master of wanderers, thieves, hermits, and all those that live on the fringe of the society of men. He taught mankind how to navigate over the sea as well as through the forest and the mountain and how to avoid the dangers of the wild. So great were the secrets he gifted to mankind that men lost faith in their true God, the Pantokrator. Furious the Pantokrator changed him into a great stone to forever deprive him of his ability to move and travel and he became the first megalith. But neither men nor giants did forget him, and the Duiu's servants carved menhirs in the cliffs of the coast where he fell asleep, before erecting them as vast and mysterious alignments that map the Earth, the Sea and the Underworld according to his teachings. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the stones are slowly changing back to flesh, and soon, followed by his sons the Hill Giants, the Duiu of Travel will retrieve his true shape and rule the world as the master of the paths."

#descr "The First Dolmen is one of, if not the most, ancient of all of this world's megaliths. Called the Trilithon due to the fact that it is the original, ideal tripartite stone structure at the centre of the material plane; and also the Gigalith due to its incredible size and mass; the First Dolmen is believed to be too ancient, huge and heavy to be the doing of any other being, even a Titan, and as such is considered one of the greatest mysteries of nature. Some even speculate that its destruction, if at all possible, could cause the end of the world by piercing the heart of the Earth. Now, with the Geodetic Awakening, the First Dolmen appears to be home to a spirit as ancient and vast as the world itself, a new pretender god, and although it is very powerful indeed, it was born in a time where magic wasn't completely formed yet, and as such doesn't master its ways as completely as other pretender gods. For this reason, all of the First Dolmen's magic paths are reduced by two levels at all times, without affecting the powers of its blessing. Still, it is an immensely powerful being and its mere presence will be enough to let the Geodetic Awakening itself escalate greatly, allowing for very quick recruitment of all kinds of stone and living commanders in controlled fortresses."

It is the perfect embodiment of living harmony, artistic inspiration and the unstoppable creativity of the origins of the world, and as such it has always been worshipped by druids, poets and singers for the ecstatic joy and spiritual fertility it gifts them with. Far more than a mere idea, the Symbol of Creation is the Primeval Triskele and one of the Seals used by the Pantokrator in times past to imprison his opponents below the earth; but now, it is awakening, and as the living beacon of its followers' hopes and aspirations it has naturally donned the holy mantle of a Pretender God."

Although his tribe is small, it is proud, strong, loyal and incredibly stubborn, and the Druid Heresiarch knows of a secret weapon that will ensure its relentless survival - a magical potion that grants long life, health, physical might and near-invulnerability to those that drink it. Thus, he has become the key to the Armaerix Tribe's victory and the greatest defender of Karanaac's Primeval Alignments. Now, the Elder Stones have elected him as their God, the Breaker of the Seal, and together with his zealous warriors, he will ensure the Geodetic Awakening's completion and the megalithic cult's hegemony. The Druid Heresiarch is a very powerful mage that masters several different paths, in particular those of Earth, Astral, Nature and Blood magic, and he will receive an additional level in each of these paths after having unlocked them."

Now, with the Pantokrator gone, she is reclaiming her rightful heritage over both the land and the sea and she has donned the holy mantle of a pretender god.

But when the Telkhines rebelled against the Pantokrator, the spirit was slain. Its master rewarded it for its loyalty by binding it in a huge statue of gold for eternity, thus bringing it back to life. It was then forgotten by all but its closest subjects, but now, with the Pantokrator gone, its powers have begun to manifest themselves and it is now worshipped as a reawakening god. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."

#descr "The Mu-Atlas Prime is one of the seven original Mu-Atlaï, primordial blemmye giants tasked since the dawn of times with holding up the sky to prevent it from falling down on the earth and precipitating the end of the world. When the Pantokrator attempted to slay his six brothers one after the other, each time his divine lightning stroke them, their tortured bodies were cut in two halves just as great and powerful as the original ones. Only noticing the Mu-Atlaï's extreme resistance after the second-to-last one had been sundered, he stopped, and only the first of all original Mu-Atlaï, the Mu-Atlas Prime, remained one and unscathed. So the Pantokrator took the sky on his own shoulders and imprisoned all Mu-Atlaï for eternity - the Mu-Atlas Prime along with his legion of brothers. Millenia later, another Pantokrator released the Mu-Atlaï to once again hold up the sky in his place, but in order to ensure their loyalty, he kept the Mu-Atlas Prime imprisoned under his watch. And now, with the last Pantokrator gone, the bonds of his prison are finally weakening, and the Mu-Atlas Prime is ready to return as the firstborn of Mu and the divine guardian-protector of the entire blemmye race, its pretender god. Although it is weaker than Titans at using traditional magic, which results in all of its magic paths being reduced by two levels without affecting his bless, he still is an extraordinarily powerful being with the combined powers of several of the other Mu-Atlaï at once, and even more. In addition to producing several Earth gems per month as the great Primogenitor of lesser blemmyes, he is able to cast Apocatastatis for free and, just like Mu-Atlas Harbingers, by making the great echoes of Mu sound again, he automatically blesses all non-inanimate friendly units at the start of every battle he takes a part in, including non-sacred ones. Even in case of death he'll always come back with his keystone in hand when called back from the Underworld by his priests."

The primeval foetus of the entire blemmye race long before man came to existence, he was the first sentient being to be shaped by Mu and has always rested outside the boundaries of known dimensions, waiting for the coming of his ultimate purpose. And now, with the Pantokrator gone, he is finally awakening and will soon complete the beautiful dream of his father by bringing back to life his entire kin and rebuilding their blessed empire as a pretender god. Like all Androgynes, the Cosmic Androgyne is a principle of love so pure that hurting him is not possible without breaking the laws of universal sympathy and risking killing oneself. Stronger than death like them and therefore immortal as well, unlike them he also is a vision of spiritual beauty beyond any other, filling the hearts of mortals with a great awe as soon as they see him. Finally, his perfect nature permanently blesses him and lets him spread dominion as if he was accompanied by three prophets at all times. In his great innocence, he is however weaker than other pretenders at traditional magic, which reduces all his paths by two levels without affecting his bless."

And now, with the Pantokrator gone, he has taken upon himself to lead the entire blemmye race to supreme glory by restoring the imaginary empire of Mu as a pretender god. Although he is less proficient at traditional magic than other pretenders, which reduces all his paths by two levels without affecting his bless, he still is an incredibly powerful mage as he can summon Titanic Protozoons much easier than his disciples. In addition, as the Living Gidouille he is the creator of the tradition of using Sacred Shells and already possesses one, which can also be used by Satraps, long before they are able to forge them."

It is rumored to have been laid by the previous Pantokrator inseminated by a Doom Horror and to contain the seed of a whole new universe, implying that, on the day it hatches, it will rebuild the world into a new, unimaginable shape - maybe that of the mythical empire of Mu. As such, its supernatural influence has always fascinated blemmyes, who worship it as a pretender god. Although the World Egg is less proficient at traditional magic than other pretenders, thus reducing all its paths by two levels without affecting its bless, it is without the shadow of a doubt an extraordinarily powerful being. First, containing the very power of creation within itself, provided that it has high enough magic paths, it will be able to cast Wish either as a Blood ritual or without any research through the Great Syzygy rituals. But even more importantly, although it cannot cast regular Syzygy rituals by itself, it will automatically create an Angel Egg for free shortly after having awakened. Finally, being a symbol of the Beginning, for similar reasons to the Cosmic Androgyne it spreads dominion, inspires awe and returns all damage done to its heart, and, just like Angel Eggs, it is able to use Ioun Foci to teleport at will."

If Bethel She'em's pretender is the Annunaki of Growth and Rebirth, no Newborn Star will ever appear and the god will always return from the dead as normal, but he will also receive a cursed crown which vastly reduces his research skill and increases his chance to receive afflictions in battle.

In the ancient times, the Paraclete didn't seem to have a will of his own and acted as a mere reflection of the Pantokrator's volition with seemingly flawless performance and loyalty; but now, with the Pantokrator's disappearance, a revolution has shaken Heaven and the Paraclete revealed himself as a being strong enough of mind and magic to command worship and don the holy mantle of a pretender god. As the original creator of all angels, the first principle of their metaphysical nature and the one and ultimate summit of the Ennearchy, he has succeeded in unifying nearly all angels under his leadership, thus creating the Litany of Cinders and ordering the hunt of all rebelious celestials. His might is incomparable to that of even Seraphs and Tetramorphs, who are but simple shards of his infinite splendor, and he is at all times followed by a retinue of angelic musicians singing his glory and smiting infidels with their holy horns, even creating from nothingness a new one every month where he is blessing the material realm with his divine presence."

#descr "It is well known by scholars that Magnificent Ind is hidden behind a veil of bizarreness and mystery. Infernal Bagpipes are believed to be one of the embodiments of this clouding weirdness and prodigy. Although these absurd entities are said to also exist in the wild and barren lands of blemmyes, a fascinating realm indeed, they are a well-established part of Ind's folklore as well. Shaped in seemingly human flesh but apparently containing highly pressurized and extremely hot vapors, these gigantic wind pouches that must come straight from another world appear to be alive and even to behave with some sort of fickle personality. With their flute-like appendages, they are capable of producing an anarchic music with which they spread the phantasmagoria of Ind everywhere they go, and with this powerful Call of Delirium, of warping reality and the mind alike in an uncontrollable tempest of utterly random events previously thought of as impossibilities."

Any Bishop General controlled by a nation other than Ind will generate twenty pounds of gold per month both for his controller and for Ind, in addition to giving Ind scouting informations about the province where he is located and to spreading Ind's dominion; however, only up to one Bishop General per province per month can perform such a task as an advisor, and being besieged by independents or being in presence of a Bishop General controlled by Ind in the same province will also stop the delegation from completing its mission."

Any province with at least one Bishop General controlled by a nation other than Ind will generate 20 gold per month for both Ind and that nation, in addition to giving Ind scouting informations about that province and to spreading Ind's dominion.

#name "Beseech the Elders"
#descr "It is known by the Pangaean elders that O'gloam, the Venerable Dusk Bear, spends most of his time slumbering deep in his hidden lairs. Although their location will always be revealed to the Awakening God when the wars of ascension begin, it is possible that in his divine tasks he will forget that information. Should this ever happen, he would still be able to retrieve it by using this ritual and sending the Steward of the Ancients to the elders as a messenger, thus requiring them to reveal their wisdom once again. However, doing so will dangerously spread word of the great Ancient's location, and so all nations that currently own one of his dens' provinces will also be made aware of it. Nevertheless, such knowledge goes both ways and, as an additional benefit, Pangaea's God too will receive confirmation of who currently controls each of these lands. The elders may only be beseeched ever so often and Skiatatoskr will be unable to cast this ritual if he already did the previous month."

#descr "In times older than civilization, titanic Beasts of Divine might, intellect and nobility were tasked with protecting Nature. Though they lost much of their influence with time and might rise against the Vengeful Forest in the near future, one of them has sided with it and will fight even them if necessary. Meleanth the thirteenth Beast used to be a great black swan admired for his sad beauty. He was killed long ago, but now, with the wars of ascension dawning upon the world, like a rotting phoenix he has returned from Beyond and pledged loyalty to the Lord of Asphodel. In addition to being physically very strong and extremely skilled in Air, Death and Nature magic, Meleanth has the power to curse the land with his mere presence. Every month he both starts and ends in the same province without hiding, he will do so unless fortifications stop his influence. As a result, for a year and a day sickness will plague inhabitants and any temple or laboratory built there will decay and crumble."

This ritual will summon him if cast in a forest where no other Divine Beast has been summoned yet and where all other Divine Beasts are currently located. Although the Steward of the Ancients is not a Divine Beast himself, only him is capable of casting this ritual, and only if he didn't cast Beseech the Elders the previous month. Like all Divine Beast summoning rituals for their own Divine Beast, this ritual may also be used to resurrect that Divine Beast if it was killed, but only if it was killed at least six months ago, and only if all the usual requirements for the chosen province are fulfilled."

Although this enchantment only affects units in the same province as the caster, its range is much higher than that of the corresponding bless."

As a result of doing so, the Exsanguine Guide gains the wondrous ability to generate three gems of Nature per month in the form of mystical elixirs; however, it is only by preserving his own existence through necromantic rituals that he avoided immediate death, and his now undead remains can only be kept functional for a few months before they collapse and his soul must depart to the Underworld. If the Exsanguine One avoids combat, he will live for eight months before dying, but his advanced state of decomposition makes him entirely unable to travel long distance and leave his current province without magical means."
#details "Caster irreversibly becomes an immobile undead with 18 HP, gains 80 undead leadership, automatically loses 2 HP per month, and generates 3 Nature gems per month."

#name "Call Zurvan"
#descr "In a powerful ritual of unorthodox sacred magic, the caster summons a Zurvan, a mysterious spirit of space and time which is said to share the nature of both the Daevas and the Yazatas. Although as an everpresent being it can fold and unfold dimensions, which allows it to cast battle spells twice as quickly as most other mages and to travel by Will and the Laws of Simultaneity, its physical manifestation is bound to the place of its summoning and will quickly fade away if ordered to take too active of a part in the destinies of mortals. The Zurvan is also highly attuned to magic and under the right scales will both access greater knowledge and greater arcane might from the Celestial Archives. Since it is of a completely ethereal nature, it is inefficient at the tasks of forging items or more generally interacting with material reality, however in the spiritual domain it is extremely powerful and with very minor adjustments can perform even the highest rituals of Caelian lore."

Ecbataan in particular generates 3 Fire gems per month and adds +2 HP to its controller's bless. The other capitals' effects are described in the corresponding spells' descriptions."

#name "Royal Restoration of Cteusiphaon"
#descr "Before the civil war, Caelum was a vast and prosperous empire and its divine Kings stretched their magnanimous reign over such vast expanses that it didn't have one but six holy capitals. Other than High Caelum itself, all of them were lost in the great chaos caused by the Daevas' perfidy, but now the Eagle Kings have retrieved their old glory at last and the living symbols of their supremacy can finally be restored. For each of the five lost capitals, five Royal Restoration rituals exist at different research levels, each regrouped with the other lost capitals' equivalents. Casting one of them in a non-besieged fort where there is no capital yet will restore the corresponding capital in the form of a site which will spread dominion and, in the case of Cteusiphaon, generate three Astral pearls per month and permanently add one level of magic resistance to its controller's bless. However each capital can only be restored once, and only one ritual can be cast in each group of five."
#details "Five lost capitals may be restored by Caelum. To do so, Royal Restoration rituals must be cast. Royal Restoration rituals exist at five different research levels. For each research level, only one may ever be cast successfully, only once, and only if the corresponding capital has not already been restored. These rituals only function when cast in non-besieged forts that do not contain any capital yet, including conquered foreign capitals and Caelum itself. Each capital spreads dominion like a temple, adds Kavi Archers and an Airya Seraphine to the fort's wall defenders, can be entered by a level 3 or more priest to summon one free Kavi Archer per month, generates 3 gems per month and permanently improves its controller's bless.

Cteusiphaon in particular generates 3 Astral gems per month and adds +1 magic resistance to its controller's bless. The other capitals' effects are described in the corresponding spells' descriptions."

#descr "Before the civil war, Caelum was a vast and prosperous empire and its divine Kings stretched their magnanimous reign over such vast expanses that it didn't have one but six holy capitals. Other than High Caelum itself, all of them were lost in the great chaos caused by the Daevas' perfidy, but now the Eagle Kings have retrieved their old glory at last and the living symbols of their supremacy can finally be restored. For each of the five lost capitals, five Royal Restoration rituals exist at different research levels, each regrouped with the other lost capitals' equivalents. Casting one of them in a non-besieged fort where there is no capital yet will restore the corresponding capital in the form of a site which will spread dominion and, in the case of Ecbataan, generate three Fire gems per month and permanently add two levels of vitality to its controller's bless. However each capital can only be restored once, and only one ritual can be cast in each group of five."

#name "Call Doom Horror"
#descr "In a cataclysmic ritual, the caster sacrifices hundreds of lives and souls to attract a Doom Horror for a limited time and direct it towards the target province. Doom Horrors are astral beings that feed on magic and the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear. They have emerged several times in history and brought misfortune and suffering to entire kingdoms. Among the mightiest beings in the universe, they have incomprehensibly powerful magic and it is unknown whether they pursue utterly alien goals or destroy purely and simply without reason. In any case, they represent an existential threat to the entire world and, should they be allowed to consume all Thrones of Ascension, they would irreversibly precipitate the cosmos in absolute despair. Six Doom Horrors are known to exist, and it is impossible to predict which one this spell will summon. It could even happen that it will summon one that is already somewhere in the material plane, then simply causing it to change location."

#name "Void Ascendance"
#descr "In a great symposium of corrupted philosophy and unholy magic, one of the Tyrant-Philosophers or another mage powerful enough to have discovered their secret sacrifices dozens of virgins to forever free himself from his prison of flesh, abandon his humanity and attain the ultimate goal of the fallen masters of Thalamanth: ascension to the eternal and nearly unlimitedly powerful nature of an Ether Daemon, another name for the uncomprehensible Horrors of the Void. Although casting this ritual is risky for its caster and can indeed force him to take an unsavory shape instead of the one he aimed for, casting it again should remain possible in most cases until the warlock attains a satisfyingly mighty status or succeeds in being completely unbound from the laws of this imperfect world. Ten different forms are possible results for this spell, but four are half as frequent and much more powerful than the others, the most sought out of which being that of the True Ether Daemon."

When pronounced, the Syllable of Annihilation produces an effect similar to that of Ruin, but with a few dramatic differences, for it is not a regular comet but a black, world-shattering Star that will fall. First, even Thrones of Ascension and Fortresses will be destroyed in the target province, and nearly all life in it will be extinguished. Second, the Star will take one additional month to reach the Earth, but no astrologer will be able to predict in time where it will land. Third, it will emanate radiations that will cause darkness and increase Death and Magic scales in the whole world. Finally, not one but twenty-four attempts to deviate the Star towards the targeted province will be made, and all of them must successfully be stopped by magic domes for the spell to ever fail."
#details "Summons a comet to the targeted province. The comet takes 4 turns to reach its destination, but even before then the whole world suffers large unrest and increases in Death and Magic scales. The whole world is warned about the comet's imminent danger as soon as the spell is cast, but the target province is only revealed the turn before the comet lands, at which point the comet also provokes world-wide darkness for two turns. Upon landing, the comet destroys any laboratory, temple, fort and throne of ascension in the target province, in addition to killing 90 percent of its population and inflicting 100 unresistible damage to every unit still located there. Destroying thrones of ascension also reduces the number of points of ascension required to win. Every time this ritual is cast, 24 attempts to complete it are made; magic domes may stop such attempts, but the spell will take full effect even if only a single attempt isn't stopped."

Second, the Star will take one additional month to reach the Earth, but no astrologer will be able to predict in time where it will land. Third, it will emanate radiations that will cause darkness and increase Death and Magic scales in the whole world. Finally, not one but twenty-four attempts to deviate the Star towards the targeted province will be made, and all of them must successfully be stopped by magic domes for the spell to ever fail."
#details "Summons a comet to the targeted province. The comet takes 4 turns to reach its destination, but even before then the whole world suffers large unrest and increases in Death and Magic scales. The whole world is warned about the comet's imminent danger as soon as the spell is cast, but the target province is only revealed the turn before the comet lands, at which point the comet also provokes world-wide darkness for two turns. Upon landing, the comet destroys any laboratory, temple, fort and throne of ascension in the target province, in addition to killing 90 percent of its population and inflicting 100 unresistible damage to every unit still located there. Destroying thrones of ascension also reduces the number of points of ascension required to win. Every time this ritual is cast, 24 attempts to complete it are made; magic domes may stop such attempts, but the spell will take full effect even if only a single attempt isn't stopped."

#name "Disintegration Cooldown"
#descr "This incredibly powerful ritual is one of the most devastating weapons known to the Aboleths, and one they only use when they face exceptional threats that need be immediately annihilated. It consists in activating the dark and ancient constructs known as the Disintegration Engines, strangely elongated black pyramids covered in enigmatic symbols that rest at the bottom of the sea. As a result of doing so, the mystical structures will enter in resonance with the Void and cause an anomalous ripple in the very fabric of magic. The resulting detonation will hit all units in the target province with tremendous force, killing all but the best armored or robust. Although this overload is too small in scale to affect the population, it is very much able to eradicate entire armies, provided that a magical dome doesn't stop the spell. After having completed this ritual, the Disintegration Engine will enter a discharged state for an entire year, unable to use it again until it has recharged."
#details "Can only be cast by a charged Disintegration Engine, which must first be recruited up to once per province in an underwater fort and upon being recruited will cause the death of 4 percent of its province's population as well as of all lobotomized slaves and shambler thralls in underwater and coastal provinces that are fully controlled by Aulgyaththu and have Aulgyaththu's dominion. As a result of casting this spell, all units still in the target province during the event phase will suffer about 30 physical damage from the chain reaction. If several Engines target the same province with this spell the same turn, the wounds suffered by the victims will add up before they can heal and the foes' chances to be killed will therefore be increased. Besides high protection or health, magical domes are the only way to resist or evade this spell. Once the spell is complete, its caster enters a discharged state for an entire year and becomes unable to cast it again until it has recharged."

#descr "As one of the most if not the most ancient race of the world and as a species gifted with infallible genetic memory, Aboleths have known the Throne of Ascensions' deepest secrets since even before the last Pantokrator ascended. As such, they are capable of decyphering the mystical protections of these metaphysical devices and as such of putting them into their complete control by the sole force of the mind. With this mighty ritual, the caster will make use of this trump card and in the name of the entire Aboleth empire will claim a throne located in the same province as himself even if he doesn't have any priestly authority. Due to the lengthy preparations it requires, this ritual won't function if the caster is located in a fort that is besieged by the enemy."
#details "The caster claims any throne of ascension located in the province as if he was a prophet. However no global announcement about it is made, and so other pretenders may fail to notice that a new throne was claimed if they do not verify it on their own. This ritual takes effect during the event phase."

#name "Paths of the Desert"
#descr "Since their release from enslavement and their exile at the hands of the other Amazon Tribes, oftentimes have the Amazons of the Garnet Tribe found asylum in the desert. Unlike real humans, they are naturally accustomed to its harsh climate, so they didn't face any opposition when founding their kingdom in the sands. Many centuries have passed since then and more than one ancient desert now hides long-forgotten relics of the Garnet Tribe. Although the Amazons still live in the desert and consider it their natural home to this day, it is vast enough that large parts of it once civilized have fallen in ruins and are now full of mystery to all but a few mystics and adventurers. Should the Amazons retrieve their ancient Earth magic, they'd be able to unearth many of the desert's treasures, and the first step for that matter might be to use this teleportation ritual which can only target wastelands - the key to open up the secret passageways that led to their lost cities in the past."

Worshipped by the Garnet Amazons and especially the Disciples of the Sun as the lords of the sands, the guardian spirits of the lands of Zun and the bringers of the end for mortals, they are called Ruby Eyes of the Desert and idolized in their temples in the form of a ruby eye adorned with a thousand wings of gold. They behave as stealthy commanders that spread heat, dominion and insanity, but they also are extremely powerful mage-priests and incredibly dangerous opponents in battle. Should they be killed, they'd explode in a vast deflagration of light and fire."

At the end of the month, a small ranger squad will be sent to confirm the criminal's death and to recover the garnet crystals that will then have formed from his remains after the passage of vultures. These precious stones will then be consumed to empower the blood of a few slaves, which will become usable to fuel blood magic. Thus, this ritual which can only target a wasteland will also require the bearer of a Mask of Submission to be located in the province; as a result, the mask bearer will be killed and an average of 30 blood slaves will be obtained in exchange. As a side effect, Heat scales will also be largely increased in the province. According to ancient Amazon laws, no more than one such condemnation per month can be executed in a given province."

They are also great sages and unparalleled craftsmen. Their dabbling in stygian magic caused their final downfall and imprisonment. Telkhines are able to change their shape. In their demonic form their magic powers over storms and the sea are increased. In human shape their skills in forging are increased. In addition, should a summoned Telkhine spend a month in the sunken city of Therodos, ancient capital of the fallen empire of Telkhinis, he would retrieve some of its old artifacts and recover a small part of his lost divinity, thus automatically gaining sacred status and an additional priestly level. This effect can only happen up to once per month and up to five times per Telkhine, and a minimal amount of province defence is required to aid the Telkhine in his search."

The Daduchoi, the Erytheian mystics of the setting sun, might also have discovered the mythical gardens, and the nymphs of Arcadeia know how to contact their sisters. Hesperides bring hope and health to the land in which they dwell.

#name "Corrupt the Crystal Ark"

This fanaticism is not without reason: if a mage of blood and astral magic could access the Ark, he could cast Astral Corruption with incredible ease and thus doom the entire world. To corrupt the Crystal Ark is only possible in Thalamanth and has the exact same effects as the aforementioned spell.

In addition, while either of these globals is active, whichever nation controls the Ark will become able to send a Blood mage to enter it and each month create nine new Crystal Mantises, powerful golems imbued with the spirits of Void Horrors; however, beware: the summoning mage is likely to eventually get lost in the Void or attract horrors towards himself, and should this spell ever be dispelled, the Crystal Mantises would be at a high risk of turning against their creators, which could very well spell the brutal end of their civilization."

When cast repeatedly by many sorcerers, it can very quickly submerge even the most experienced troops under the continuous assault of a thousand birds."

#descr "Making appeal to the highest of the Cloud Sages' wisdom, the caster awakens, or rather infuses with life and will, two inseparable True Wind Spirits. True Wind Spirits are strange magical and almost immaterial living beings that feed upon mere poetry and nothing else. Even though their sustenance and substance are both spiritual in nature, they are completely mindless even when compared to animals and they cannot comprehend anything else than pure emotion, which paradoxically doesn't prevent them from having or even maybe being abstract and usually pretty random feelings. When Thalamanth's Cloud Sages awaken their passion for freedom and beauty in the right way, they take the form of ethereal birds and strike with living thunder all that is earthly and low. They don't care about any kind of justice or logic and don't need any reason to behave as they do. Storms increase their powers without troubling their flight."

They are often found in hidden mountain valleys where they impose themselves as rulers over lesser birds. Known for its great nimbleness and sharp talons, their silver variety is very common in the lands of Thalamanth and is ruled by kings of large size. Silver Hawk Kings are clever enough to master Air magic and endless flocks of birds accompany them in battle."

Mist Avatars are incredibly powerful air elementals, living tempests that take the vague shape of a giant eagle. While all of them were born Titan-Eagles, they chose to make the noble sacrifice of their flesh in order to serve Thalamanth with unbound magical power and rage. Now that their body is composed of billowing clouds and mist, they are entirely unable to enter water even with the aid of magic, however they also are extraordinarily difficult to harm, especially since their self-reforming and nearly immaterial essence is protected from cold and fire alike by their newly gained powers over celestial waters. In addition, just like Titan-Eagles, they continuously create new air elementals during battle, and they do so with even greater efficiency."

After a decisive victory, the Basilei were able to conclude a sacred Pact with their Queens. The rock where this pact was sealed can still be seen in Triliax to this day, as a reminder of the Amazons' honorable ways. Indeed, the Queens were willing to give a monthly tribute, and in exchange Triliax would be their ally rather than their enemy. But there was a catch: should one day Triliax need the Amazons' help, they would surely come, but this would mark the end of their debt. With this spell, a Basileus can call to his aid an Amazon Queen and her army, composed of more than a hundred heavily armed horsewomen and three warrior-sorceresses. However, the Rock of the Pact will be destroyed as a result. The Amazons must travel a long way to reach the Divine Citadel, so this spell will only take effect three months after having been cast rather than one as usual."

Its main function is to remind the people of Triliax of the great miracle of the Sacred Walls of Dardanum and of the inevitable victory of Civilization over savagery. The mere presence of one such pillar is enough to increase the wisdom of savants in the region and to improve their research abilities. Although the pillars can be summoned everywhere, High Priests cannot be recruited outside of provinces of their element. A pillar is also required for the recruitment of Troll Archons in underwater provinces, but it is gradually damaged by erosion while underwater and thus will be rendered completely useless after one year in such an environment."

#descr "This sacred ritual is reminiscent of the founding myth of Triliax.

The Horses of Trilios are sacred spirits of the sea which are rumored to be the last remnants of the great hero's semi-divine steeds. They take the shape of surging waves of raging sea water, foam and algae with the vague traits of a horse of large size. For the most part they are similar to Water elementals, but they have a soul, can be blessed, gallop at high speeds, and in battle, rather than shrinking when hurt, highten the heart of all Triliaxian warriors and crush the enemy under their thundering hooves."

These giant wooden constructs are used by the forces of Triliax in warfare to transport and protect troops until they can storm the enemy's forts. They are enchanted to be able to move without external help and crush the Basilei's foes under their heavy wheels; but the most important of their strengths comes from the fact that they are almost completely hollow, allowing them to shelter betwixt their mechanisms the bodies, supplies and full equipment of about twenty trained warriors. Thus, this number of elite myrmidons will exit the Horse's belly at the start of every battle and fight by its side for the glory of Triliax. Being fully reloaded in troops and furniture after every battle, although it is slow, vulnerable to fire and entirely unable to go underwater, this war machine truly is one of the greatest trump cards of the nation."

As such, they are living embodiments of the Cloud Republic's aspirations and they are able to directly drain the faith of mortals before it can reach heaven. They shine like the sun and anyone daring to strike them risks losing their eyes forever. They can be recruited in all Circles of Knowledge as soon as a Primordial Eagle has reentered the world, but through this ritual they can also be summoned by them, or by other powerful priests of the sun such as some Heirs of the Sun even before that time."

Like their father, they are immortal and will be reborn from their ashes if too much harm is done to them.

A burning aura of blinding light surrounds them at all times, making them even more dangerous to the touch than Solar Birds. Until Primordial Eagles are brought back to the world, they are the only ones in Nephelococcygia that can produce Phoenix Feathers and thus give others their immortality."

They truly are divine beings and once they roam again the earth and the skies, their foes shall tremble with very good reason."

Soon after, many of these tribes will ready themselves for war and start to join the Republic of the Clouds. Every month, each province of the world has a chance to host a hidden army of winged warriors awaiting orders in hiding. Sacred Iconoclasts will also appear outside the caster's territory, hiding and spreading chaos and heresy. Forests and mountains have a higher chance of seeing birds joining the Revolution. Seas, caves and provinces devoid of life will all be spared, due to the rarity of birds in these places. As a result, not only will the caster gain control of a vast flying army, but he will also gain a huge amount of scouting information, seeing virtually all the world's provinces. However, all nations of the world will be warned of that fact and able to react by increasing their defenses or sending patrols to hunt down the rebels."

Quite regularly, some unorthodox Sauromancers, maybe even heretics to their kind, come to the Library in order to teach their forgotten secrets, and they are always welcomed and admired by many as fascinating wells of knowledge and wisdom. These mystic scholars speak of what lies Beyond the Veils and are great masters of death and astral magic that know how to extract death gems from the sacred C'tissian sites hidden in Isphenople's lands. They are also powerful augurs who divine the future with an almost troubling ease, and no-one in Isphenople questions their priestly authority."

The statue is imbued with great priestly powers and has some powers over astral magic as well, but is immobile. In addition, it can command many magical beings in battle, and if the province in which it is located has a temple and is under both Sloth scales and friendly dominion, with its words of wisdom it will have a monthly chance of attracting new scholarly visitors whose gifts to the local sacred library will be usable as Astral pearls. The chances for this to happen will be higher the stronger Sloth scales are in the province and won't increase if several telestic figures occupy the same province."

#descr "For centuries, the Gnostics have worshipped the Dazzling Darkness of a God of pure, unfathomable thought. Although this God is entirely antithetical to the impurity of matter, one of its lowest hypostases, the inflexible Sophia, could incarnate within a sacred Vessel built with enough care and complex magic. Thus, the Unutterable Vessel was conceived to receive her soul and seal the God's final victory against this flawed world. The pinnacle of Isphenople's art, it is a living cathedral, a colossal statue in the perfect form of a six-winged angel. Still, Sophia's true power is mystical and will yet have to manifest even after the Vessel has been built. Located at the apex of each school of magic's research tree, the five Unutterable Knowledge rituals serve this purpose. Each will further anchor Sophia's divine soul to the Vessel, making it increasingly awe-inspiring and powerful. Only one Vessel can exist at any time but it can be rebuilt multiple times by recasting this ritual."

That ceremony makes use of the First Baetyl to permeate the earth with a powerful aura; as such, it can only be achieved in Nabatem, where there must be an active Obelisk, and no more than once per month.

#name "Lift the Curse"
#descr "With this powerful ritual, a great benediction is bestowed upon the land and its inhabitants by the Elder Stones, and the ancient curse that had petrified so many mortals in the eons past is lifted. As soon as the sun rises, under the gentle touch of its light rays, stones will return to their original form and be reborn as beings of flesh, blood and bone. This will have the overall effect of increasing population in the targeted province by approximately a thousand and a half people. Due to astronomic cycles, this ritual cannot affect a given province more than once per month."

Indeed, megaliths are considered sacred and worshipped almost everywhere in the world, at least for as long as mortals remain naive enough to ignore their true purposes. But there is a specific people that both knows of the Awakening and still reveres it with all its strength: an ancient coastal Tribe that once was part of Marverni's confederacy and that has always guarded the Primeval Alignments of Karanaac as the most sacred place in the world. With this ritual, a ceremonial Stone Circle used by the druids of that Tribe - the Armaerix - will be erected as some of them break their allegiance to Marverni and join the Awakening to serve it. Although they'll require gold for their daily rituals and earthly needs, thus reducing the province's income permanently, they'll also become recruitable and allow for the later casting of the powerful Armaerix Oppidum ritual."

A World Shard is, quite literally, an ancient Shard of the World, an unteleportable stone of tremendous size and magical power that is engraved across its whole surface with a lattice of natural runes representing the mystical tapestry of the earth, its telluric lines. As the direct depositories of the World-Soul's might, World Shards are very powerful mages of earth and nature, and in battle their wrath tears apart the very fabric of the world, causing terrible earthquakes to crush and swallow all troops on the battlefield, but also heavily damaging inanimate beings, including themselves. In addition, the entire province in which a World Shard is located will see its growth scales increasing, as under the great stone's influence the soil retrieves its primordial fertility."

But in spite of that weakness, they are very powerful indeed, due to their ability to continually cast spells for as long as intruders are present, as well as to the three temporary death gems they can use each battle.

#name "Ageless Cromlech"
#descr "Cromlechs are great stone circles of almost perfect shape, commonly used by druids as astronomical clocks, in which several dolmens enter a 'communion of communions'. Like dolmens, and even more so, their vast wisdom and enlarged sentience allow them to be extraordinarily good leaders, and in addition they have great ritual powers over nature and the stars. But what truly distinguishes them from other megaliths is their unique ability to cast the Gateway, Astral Travel and Telluric Convergence rituals - a feat that no other truly immobile being is capable of. Thus, Ageless Cromlechs are commonly used by the Geodetic Awakening to instantaneously teleport whole communion arrays of menhirs and singing stones in sudden megalithic attacks of huge scope that should be able to get rid of all living opposition in the targeted province."

#descr "Boreads are powerful spirits of the northern wind and ancient allies of ancient heroes such as Trilios and the Fifty, who met them and helped them during their mythical travels. Since then, although most of them still answer the call of their sisters - the nymphs of Arcadeia and the aurae of Thalamanth -, many among them have instead become benevolent protectors of Triliax or Cyanautha and secretly brought their blessing upon its inhabitants, curing ill and keeping evil at bay. They manifest as incredibly beautiful women whose misty silhouette is exceedingly hard to hit. Few mortals would dream of harming a Boread. Their touch is as soft as their laughter, and everywhere they go, they bring bliss and happiness, unless they must smite mortals with the fury of frost and storms. They are sacred heralds of the God and master air and water magic so well that they'll start every battle with a temporary gem of each of these elements in their possession."

Although the Divine Champions can also spontaneously appear at the gates of the capital as any hero would, any number of them can also be called down this way. They are similar to Chryselephantine Champions in their abilities, but have even greater skills, in particular when it comes to sailing. But their greatest strength comes from their immortality, gifted to them by the Awakening God in times past to reward them for having saved Argolinth from impending doom at the Pantokrator's hands. In addition, each is a powerful war mage of water and air and also masters a third path, or in some cases wields sacred authority akin to that of a prophet."

While at first it could appear useless, in truth it contains nearly unlimited potential and, given enough time, is able to make the impossible come true. At the apex of the season opposite to that of its summoning - in other words, at either the solstice or the equinox four to six months after its apparition -, it will reach maturation and for a single month gain the unique ability to either grant a huge research boost or cast a Syzygy ritual with incredibly powerful effects, before it inevitably disappears at the end of the month. In the meantime, it will spread Magic, grant weak research and be able to build laboratories even without magic skills."

It causes the caster to restart its life cycle, reentering its chrysalis as soon as it hatches and thus avoiding death; but more than that, it also causes its spiritual shadow to duplicate and be reborn, thus summoning a second, new Angel Egg in a random controlled province. The new Angel Egg cannot appear the same month as this Syzygy occurs but will definitely materialize one or a few months later, the likelihood increasing with the number of available provinces. No more than five Angel Eggs can be pending apparition this way; if this spell is cast while five Angel Eggs are already pending apparition, no new Angel Egg will appear, but the caster will still reincarnate."

Thus, like all Syzygy rituals, the Syzygy of Origination can only be triggered by the maturation of an Angel Egg. As a result, a powerful Ioun Focus will coalesce from the light of the dying Angel Egg. It is an item that can only be used by Surreal Aberrations and Angel Eggs themselves, including non-matured ones, and which allows them to teleport at will. Once created, the Ioun Focus will automatically be placed in the treasury. It is generally brought to an Angel Egg by a Surreal Aberration and then used to bring that Angel Egg to a laboratory before it reaches maturity. Due to some idiosyncrasies of the astronomical cycles, this spell cannot be cast successfully more than once per province in a given month."

Almost brainless and therefore very resistant to fear and magic, these terrifying war snails have a highly corrosive saliva which can cause both flesh and steel to melt, and their almost formless body has impressive regenerative properties. While generally slow, they feel at ease in swamps and have no issue surviving underwater. In battle, they ensnare their aggressors in very sticky slime, and when hurt badly enough they temporarily retreat inside their shell and wait for their wounds to heal, which is rarely more than a matter of minutes."

Like their close cousins the Cave Cows, Blemmye Cows are strange beings from the under-earth that feed on fungi and minerals, and thus do not need any particular upkeep or supplies to sustain themselves. Their saliva is highly corrosive and can dissolve rocks and minerals as well as bronze and steel armors. Thanks to their powerful jaw, they can spit that substance at greater distances than regular Cave Cows, and since they also have three additional stomachs, they are able to do so for a longer duration before they run out of saliva. They produce a strange, slimy, translucent milk which is often consumed by sciapods both in times of peace when dwelving in sterile caves and in times of war when pillaging barren lands. Blemmye Cows can both be summoned and recruited in caverns."

#descr "With a huge sacrifice of blood, the caster convinces a mighty and power-hungry Eye Tyrant to join his cause. Maybe the most monstrous of all sentient blemmyes, the individualistic Eye Tyrants also are among the most intelligent and cruel. These absurd creatures are known for their incredibly vast ego as well as for their levitating body, seemingly made out of a single giant eye, a horrible jaw that devours souls and many small life-draining tentacles. Although the skin and cornea of Eye Tyrants are extremely vulnerable, their body remains bulky enough to endure profound wounds. Coupled with their ability to use crowns, their immense mastery of blood magic and the frighteningly destructive powers of both their gaze and their bite, this makes them very dangerous dark sorcerers. In exchange for their loyalty, they must be allowed to devour about thirty people per month, but this is indeed a very small price to pay for their power."

Surreal Aberrations are the first heralds of Mu, and their mere presence brings to reality the realms of imagination and insanity, dismantling logic and self-consistency as in a dream within a dream. These inconceivable monstrosities take the shape of giant spiders entirely made out of disproportionately long human legs joined by a headless human torso that pulses with visions of horror. Their nightmarish appearance is furthermore aggravated by their inhuman mobility, as they move with seemingly unequalled speed, in addition to being able to climb walls and ceilings with perfect ease. Unstoppable creepers that hide in darkness to spread madness in foreign lands or ambush key leaders of the enemy, these mindless, unholy creatures are able to destroy reason with a mere touch, feedbleminding their foes if not outright killing them."

Completely defenseless on their own, these huge balls of fat and brains which resemble limbless bodies with a face lack any way to feed or move themselves. Extremely lazy and gluttonous, they are nourrished and protected by the sciapods in exchange for doing the hardest kind of work there is for them: thinking. Immensely more efficient in this task if their masters do not allow them to slack off, or in other words, when they bully them and force them to work under Production scales, these immobile and inoffensive researchers still are very useful under Sloth scales. In addition, along with Eye Tyrants, they are the only blemmyes capable of making use of crowns, and in particular Ioun Stones, which furthermore increase their cognitive abilities."

Although they are the closest thing there is to a mage, savant or erudite in U, they are so over-specialized that they almost only know about a single, very restrictive matter, usually a spell which they master so perfectly that they can cast it at will, without any cost. The Sophotatos summoned by this specific ritual dreams of becoming a true evoker and is adept in the arts of destruction through magical fire. As such, he knows how to cast Fireball for free and has the potential to one day become an authentic Fire mage. He also has developed high resistances to all elements and knows how to purify his body from wounds."

#descr "Brimming with a primeval emotion of incomparable beauty and sincerity, this most holy ritual finally completes an eon-long cycle by bringing back one of the sacred Androgynes from the origins of the world. Long before the birth of man or other blemmyes, the Androgynes were perfect beings gifted with a dual nature. Each had two opposite faces, four legs and four arms, but only one soul and none of the human heart's defects. These true Avatars of Love were the most ravishing of all of the gods' creations, but when the Pantokrator dismembered Mu he also used divine lightning to cut through his pure children, separating them in two incomplete halves each and thus ending the Age of Love with that of Hatred. Should they return to this world, the Androgynes, Ideal Blemmyes, would be instrumental to rebuilding the great dream of Mu. Stronger than death and disharmony, these awe-inspiring, innate mage-priests are immortal and anyone that hurts them will suffer from his own violence."

#descr "From the fertile soil of Mu's perpetually decaying body, the caster shapes, creates or summons a Protozoic Amalgamation, a creeping meat monster made of dozens upon dozens of disparate arms, legs and mouths. Perpetually seeking for more organic matter to consume, it will devour every living thing it touches, regenerating at an alarming speed and potentially growing to an absurdly large mass. Abominable to the world and the gods alike, it possesses all creature types, and although it is very difficult to control and fails to distinguish between humans and blemmyes when looking for more to eat, it still is one of the most dangerous and terrifying weapons of U."

#descr "With a sacred ritual of great power, the caster summons a Titanic Protozoon, that is to say a gigantic, holy foot or fist animated by a mysterious force. Even though they are devoid of magical abilities, Titanic Protozoons undoubtedly are among the most dangerous and nonsensical creatures of this world. Seemingly living extensions of the Will of the God, they smite his enemies by jumping up to incommensurable heights and by crushing them upon landing, potentially destroying entire armies in a single strike. These prodigious leaps makes them functionally flying beings, which causes them to be very hard to escape; and their unsurpassable strength and vitality makes them extremely hard to kill or resist as well. Truly, their gargantuan shadow is a vision of both existential dread and mystical rapture for the mere mortal that contemplates his last moments before being liquefied by their implacable force."

Every time a non-Blood magic ritual is cast or a magic item is forged, there is a chance that a Horror will follow the arcane flow and attack the mage. The spell lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies, and unlike the normal Astral Corruption ritual it can be cast underwater."

As a result of this spell taking effect on land, the victims will suffocate and take severe damage. Even though the spell won't avoid allied soldiers, they will still be immune to its effects, for docile slaves are granted by their Aboleth overlords the right to live by being provided with another very similar substance which temporarily allows them to breathe water and protects them from the air of the surface by enveloping them."

#name "Etch Tetragrammaton"
#descr "By remotely etching one of the seventy-two holy Names of the God, the caster causes a blazing Tetragrammaton to manifest and gain life in the target province. Although completely immobile, unteleportable even with the help of magic and very vulnerable in battle, Tetragrammatons are useful priest-mages and beacons of power instrumental to Bethel She'em's glory. Each month, every province with a Tetragrammaton and a temple will attract at least one Angel, more appearing in strong dominion and Order scales, culminating at a total of seven angels per month on average under perfect conditions. In addition, every province with a Tetragrammaton, a temple, a laboratory and friendly dominion has one percent chance per level of dominion strength to attract a Harbinger every month. Finally, every province with a Tetragrammaton, a temple, a fort, maximal Order scales and friendly dominion also has a one percent chance per level of dominion strength to attract a Principality every month."

From the angels of the lowest rank, which only very rarely are Transubstantiated to become Harbingers but much more frequently receive the intermediate promotion and honor of receiving a name and a heavenly horn, they retain this wondrous weapon which destroys undead beings and mortal flesh as well as their winged humanoid shape and radiant aura; but unlike them, they also have high enough sanctity and might to act as lowly officers, priests and mages. They are generally tasked with leading the angelic choirs in worship as well as in war, announcing dramatically important events to mortals, installing permanent outposts in prevision for the coming of higher entities and assisting them in the performing of holy and arcane rituals."

Cloaked in blazing fires of kindness and equity, they are leaders of nearly unparalleled skills within the Ennearchy, only equaled in holy charisma by the supreme Seraphs and Tetramorphs. They are also divine warriors that wield solar flames both through arcane potency and their resplendant blade, a consecrated sword known as a Flambeau, which destroys any demonic being it touches. Along with Taxiarchs, who share a similar rank and power level with them, they command the angelic hosts to war and ensure that the Will of the God is done on Earth and in Heaven alike."

Dominations are angels of superior dignity and eldritch appearance, highly powerful and nearly unfatiguable Astral mages as well as entities of great telepathic power able to directly attack the mind of their foes. The unnatural substance that constitutes their body is nearly indestructible and highly resistant to magic, all elements and even magical weapons. They are able to teleport at will at almost unlimited distances and they can even impose their might underwater without being inconvenienced by the absence of breathable air. They are at all times followed by four smaller and weaker dimensional reflections of their own self called Singing Diamonds, which are also able to use Astral magic in combat, and when nearly destroyed they themselves temporarily transform into a Singing Diamond in order to avoid annihilation. Finally, they will receive one additional level of Earth magic if empowered in that path."

#descr "Like the higher Tetramorphs, Dominations are so powerful beings that they cannot entirely manifest in the material realm. Instead, Dominations can only project a small part of their body in this reality. In fact, according to a popular conjecture among philosophers and mathematicians, they are dwellers of higher spatial dimensions, and the entity that can be seen and touched by mortals is but some kind of tridimensional section or shadow of the Domination's true form, which cannot materialize in any fuller way. This at the very least explains why the geometrical structure of Dominations seems to be able to change so widely all the while being so impervious to damage, as well as how these creatures can teleport across the world so easily. As a result, scholars believe they understand why Dominations are followed by four singing diamonds at all times: these actually are dimensional reflections of their own self, incomplete manifestations of other parts of their inaccessible body."

#selectspell 691 -- Transformation
#name "Transformation"
#descr "Only a few Nature mages know the secret of how to cast this spell. The caster is transformed into a random monster or animal. Some monsters, such as fire drakes, are closely attuned to an element or other magical path. If the caster successfully transforms into such a being he might gain magic power. Also the casters new body is young and healthy. The transformation is not without risk, however, as the caster's mind and body may be damaged in the process. Sometimes a failed transformation can result in the form of a mindless being and usually mind and magic abilities are lost as a result. But sometimes a being with powerful magic can retain his magic ability as the magic is too strong to let the absence of a mind stop it. The caster will thus be able to cast this spell again in most cases, but may permanently lose the ability to do so should he transform into a true monstrosity."
#details "Beings who are able to cast this ritual have an indication of that fact in their description. This includes most, but not all, recruitable mages with several levels in Nature magic, and a few with only one level, as well as most possible results of the spell itself. This however does not include crossbreeds, and neither summoned nor unique monsters are generally willing to cast this spell. The caster transforms into a young monster, but lost limbs are still lost after the transformation. The chance of failure is 20% reduced or increased by the Luck/Misfortune scale value. If cast under water the transformation results in a water being."

#descr "In Magnificent Ind, there are many subservient kingdoms, and some of them are close enough to virtue that the Prester King has let them keep relative autonomy. Subservient kingdoms of that kind are not ruled by Viceroys from Ind, but by local kings, loyal enough to the Lord that they are trusted to spread His holy Order and justice throughout the land. Should one such king prove himself faithful and worthy enough, he would be rewarded by receiving a Subservient Crown from Ind. Although such a crown will bind its bearer to his land of origins forever, and although it will also forbid him from using Blood magic, it will help him change the province's scales to one more suitable of the peace and discipline taught by the Lord. In addition, when worn by specific commanders assisted by specific advisors, the Subservient Crown will complete a Subservient Court in the province where it is located, under the condition that this province has a fort, a laboratory, a temple and friendly dominion. Although each province can only have one active Subservient Court of any given type at most, when at peace such a province will receive free troops from the appropriate kingdom every month. The Court of Feminie is unlocked by giving the crown to a Feminie Queen assisted by at least five Feminie Sorceresses; the Court of Piconye is unlocked by giving the crown to a Piconye King assisted by at least five Piconye Scholars; and the Court of Orionde is unlocked by giving the crown to an Orionde King assisted by at least five Great Huntresses."

Invented by the noble queen that originally created that prestigious institution, it is the result of years of research on poisons, which she accomplished primarily by testing their effects on condemned criminals to find the least cruel way to kill - a benevolent goal which explains why her servants were so incompromisingly loyal to her, even after her downfall. Taking the form of a small ruby-eyed snake, it is enchanted to recognize basic commands from its owner, including one which lets it animate itself to behave like a real asp. A small cavity in its fangs allows its user to fill it with deadly poison which the golden asp may then use once in battle when biting its foes, after which it becomes discharged and forced to attack with teeth and metal alone. This wondrous item requires secret knowledge of the Order of the Golden Asp to be of any use and won't serve the Assassins' enemies if one of their numbers falls in battle."

By putting them on, suitable users are capable of taking on the aspect of the Winds, thus striking their enemies with the furor of the Ouragan and taking care of their friends with the sweetness of the Breeze. As a result, the user benefits from several mighty effects: increased skills in Air and Water magic, the power to conjure two temporary Air gems per battle, the ability to fly even during storms, medium protection against lightning, and such delectable grace that she may dodge most attacks, stealthily move in enemy territory, and there, attempt to seduce mortals with her enchantments."

And there may very will be some truth to their holy lore, for such a relic will indeed bestow great mystical gifts upon whoever takes good enough care of it. In addition to surrounding its bearer with chilly winds which over time might very well become lethal to anyone without protection from them, including its user, if preserved from destruction the fragile Star of Frozen Petals will slowly and naturally spread its great cold aura in the entire province where it is located. But more importantly, thanks to its core of prismatic ice it can be used to focus light and gain limited control over it.

Although the truth about its creation is unknown to human beings, it is not to illithids, who appear to use it as a powerful magical focus imbued with the energies of the Void. Thus, by channeling their power through such a crystal skull, a mage will become able to warp dimensions in such a way that his supernatural abilities will be greatly improved. This will allow him to remain lucid even in the presence of aberrant phenomena, to cast battle spells twice as quickly as most other mages all the while resisting exhaustion, to instinctively pierce magical resistance, to spread the influence of Magic scales in the province where he is located and to easily find his way through the Void and to the material plane if he ever became lost beyond the natural edges of this world."

Furthermore, there is enough of the wondrous substance in this precious relic to heal one additional affliction per month for any target in the same province, but its power will be weakened when applied to someone else than the legitimate guardian of the item and will therefore not have any additional effect in such a case. Although anyone can be healed by its dark waters, the Stygian Chalice is protected by magical safeguards against pillagers and will only recognize female beings such as Kokythiades and priestesses as its rightful mistresses."

#descr "Created in a gruesome sacrifice to the primordial powers of unbound chaos and fertility, this mystical orb of viridian fluid awakens the divine blood of Typhon in its owner's veins, thus permanently and irreversibly gifting him with the supernatural lifeforce of the most mythical of Hydras. As a result, he will receive a great surge of vitality, regenerate from wounds at supernatural speeds, easily recover both from fatigue and afflictions, and become attuned to serpentkind in such a way that he will become more efficient when summoning lamias or drakes. In exchange, he will also become highly vulnerable to fire, a weakness inherited from the sacred monstrosities that granted him their strength. This item cannot affect undead or inanimate beings in any way."

Although it is a traditional martial symbol and as such can only be used by mounted female commanders, it allows them to perform the holy sacraments and to train new Oiorpatas in temples at a lower cost. The spear can also be used in battle to imbue her user with divine insights that will highly increase her fighting skills in exchange for a costly sacrifice of holy reagents. Even though Sauromatian Manflayers are mounted female commanders, since they lack priestly authority, very strong taboos forbid them from ever touching a Ceremonial Spear and they will be swiftly killed as a punishment for their sacrilege if they ever do so."

But it is far more than a mere seal, for it is enchanted with dark powers supposed to help the Krypteia's Master in his most important tasks. As such, it will know if its user gets wounded and, should this happen, will immediately teleport him back to his own province, even healing him from his afflictions by doing so. If the home castle has been conquered by the enemies, the returning will most likely become disastrous, but happily this is not the last of the Seal's powers. Indeed, it also gifts the Master of Krypteia with the God-Slayer's sacred protection at all times, thus blessing him even without the aid of a priest. In addition, when wearing it the Unnamed One will stop attempting to reduce unrest in the provinces where he dwells, which is useful when hiding in enemy territory but means that the Seal might be better left unused in the treasury when its Master doesn't need it; in other words, removing the Seal and thus hiding his true function will let the Master of the Krypteia use intrigue to disarm rebellion among the helote population and manipulate it to reduce unrest at an incredibly quick rate in the province where he dwells. Although this precious item is not cursed, the Master of the Krypteia is the only being who knows how to circumvant its protections, and thus the only one who can use it."

Although a mage in possession of the Obsidian Sigil will see his ability to cast rituals enhanced with addictive potential and will become able to command the armies of both the Living and the Dead with great ease, he also will be cursed immediately upon taking it for himself and, unable to let go of it from then on, he will most likely end up being devoured by the cosmic horrors that this mysterious item attracts so quickly."

That sacrifice required the death of thousands, and only pure and innocent hearts were suitable for its fulfillment. The back then young race of the Pale Ones was chosen for the sacrifice, and thus countless children of the earth died in the horrible ceremony that forever enclosed unutterable evil within the God Vessels and their eternal Chamber. Then, the survivors began their timeless vigil as the blessed Guardians of the Seal.

It is often whispered in Agartha that the souls of the sacrificed ones became the abhorrent Umbrals and Penumbrals that dwell within the dark far below. But the truth is even sadder than that, for most of the victims actually remained imprisoned along with the shattered deities they helped defeat. Thus, their poor, fragile souls were immediately seized by the unnameable entities and as a dull outlet of their unending hatred, suffering and madness were relentlessly tortured and shredded to pieces until the present days.

Now, only a few small pearls of fathomless darkness remain of their innumerable tears, and each of the God Vessels keeps one with him at all times as a toy and a reminder of all that was taken from him."

When girded by a being of sufficiently great stature, the Diadem of the Gigantes will reveal to all onlookers the true majesty of his semi-divine nature.

Only usable by female beings, this very valuable item permanently weakens its user, thus reducing her magic resistance and strength, but also gifts her with several mighty supernatural abilities. First, it allows her to receive to her questions answers from the gods, thus vastly improving her insights in magical research and letting her single-handedly spread Luck scales in the province where she dwells; second, from her elevated state of mind she will receive acute spiritual senses, which will heighten her magic penetration and make her an automatic communion master. Finally, through mithridatization the offering will make her slightly resistant to all poisons, and provided that she has sacred status she will also be protected by the One's blessing at all times. Additionally, any province with a temple, friendly dominion, some province defence, maximal Order scales and at least one Oracular Offering will once per year on average receive large religious donations from the faithful of foreign lands in the form of magical gems and gold."

It contains a small quantity of that odd fluid secreted by the Aboleths which makes anyone that consumes it incapable of breathing without it but also allows to breathe water as if it was air. Being affected by that viscous substance for sure means perpetual enslavement but also makes it possible to avoid more than a few fates worse than death, so many are the commanders that willingly albeit disgustingly accept the dubious honor of giving up their lungs the soft rather than the hard way."

#name "Mind Worm"
#descr "Strange symbiotes gifted with strong, innate psychic abilities, Mind Worms are a product of the Aboleth art of flesh warping and one of the greatest demonstrations of their magical mastery and subtelty. When put into direct contact with a suitable host - which cannot be an inanimate being -, they fuse with her body and vastly empower her mind by unlocking its latent potential, but not without a great cost. Indeed, while the host will see her mental capacity both natural and paranormal increase to properly phenomenal heights, her very personality will also be affected and undergo irreversible changes, thus forcing her to use her newly acquired talents to ceaselessly spread pure chaos around her, even taking advantage of her enhanced intelligence to plan several steps ahead of whoever attempts to hunt her and to avoid getting caught by them.
As such, the item's user will noticeably increase the chance for bad events to occur in the province where he dwells. In addition, Mind Worms are naturally linked to the Void and in an odd reaction will automatically horror mark their hosts twice per month unless they are highly magical beings, a particularity that makes Aboleths and Androdai ideal bearers of the symbiote.
In exchange for all these impediments, the host will see her cognition and magic power vastly improved. In addition to receiving increased magic resistance, magic penetration and reinvigoration, she will become an innate spell caster also able to expand the Mind Worm's energy as per the consumption of one temporary Astral pearl per battle. Finally, anyone who succeeds in the task of killing her in spite of the odds will trigger an explosion of psychic energies akin to that produced by the polypal mothers upon their deaths and will make the Mind Worm attempt to find a new host among the battle's survivors in order to ensure its survival."

#name "The Shape of Water"
#descr "Even to the Aboleths themselves, The Shape of Water is a very enigmatic entity. If indeed even their infallible genetic memory knows nothing of its origins and therefore of its true nature, it can only mean one thing: that it came to existence in a time that predated not only the Elder Race itself but all other sentient life as well - otherwise, it is inevitable that with the passing eons the Aboleths would eventually have found, devoured and assimilated such an ancient mind along with all its recollections of the past. Since all Aboleths agree that together they remember the birth of all conscious beings they ever encountered, The Shape of Water must either be the materialization of an eternal principle, a primordial and yet unique product of the natural order of the Cosmos, or very troubling but unmistakable evidence of some unsolvable anomaly in the Aboleths' collective mental reconstruction of the past Ages. Regardless of the truth, it is impossible for the Aboleths to refrain their endless fascination of that unfathomable presence, and for millenia upon millenia they have studied it with the closest thing there is in their culture to religious deference. Postulated by several erudites to be the very origin of oceanic life long before the apparition of complex organisms, The Shape of Water holds much, much greater magical power than could ever be imagined by an orginary spell caster and among other things is said to have served as an ideal template for the creation of the imperfect but already mighty Aphotic Orbs. In addition to gaining virtually unlimited control over the element of Water in the form of 8 temporary gems at the start of every battle and of the ability to cast Tidal Wave at will, the fortunate bearer of this artifact will become able to cast spells from a much longer range than usual, to cast rituals with enhanced skill in all paths, to predict future events with immense accuracy and to harness nearly two true Nature gems per month on average."

An Aphotic Orb of Abhorrence is the dormant form of an Uboath, an abominable entity created by the Aboleths to trap and exterminate mortal intruders. When awakened, the Uboath adopts a shape similar to that of a Water elemental and starts behaving like a golem, obeying orders with relentless and merciless efficiency. The Uboath is made out of a disgusting dark liquid that is always cold to the touch and whose unnatural properties make some scholars suspect that it might be related in nature to Gore Tide Horrors. That creature is sacred to the Aboleths but causes great repugnance and fear in the hearts of mortals. Unlike Water elementals, Uboaths do not shrink when hurt and are very hard to destroy thanks to their highly efficient regenerative abilities; their slime is both sticky and glacial, which makes them very hard to escape, but they also have a dramatic weakness to Fire, a fact that very few would suspect at a first glance."

The twisted and blackened leaves of the crown still command the respect of the Lictors of Ermor, who will remember their ancient oaths and shamble forth to mete out the justice of their dictator. Two additional Lictors are summoned with the spell Revive Lictor. This item is only useful to the Ashen Empire of Ermor after the Decree of Extinction has been proclaimed."

They use it in their hecatombs, ritual slaughters in which at least a hundred bulls and humans are killed together in a great sacrifice to the God. It is both a powerful weapon to use in combat and a very useful tool for religious matters. This item is a royal symbol of Knoss and can only be used by the Wanax."

It is traditionally crafted by a Knossian Queen as a sacred gift to her husband and master the King. For this reason, it is one of the greatest symbols of authority in the kingdom. Its user will receive both the physical and the mental strength of a true royalty, and blood slaves will always be gifted to him before battles so that he can sacrifice them in a display of power and cruelty before his enemies. This is also a very protective piece of armor and, unlike other helms, it allows its wearer to use his gore attack. This item is a royal symbol of Knoss and can only be used by the Wanax."

#descr "A sinister emblem of Zun's matriarchy, the Mask of Submission is a terracotta mask of very simple shape and pale color. It has only three holes, one for the mouth and one for each eye, and is devoid of ornamentations, save for the palm of a hand drawn in red paint on the forehead to represent the power the Garnet Amazons exert on the wearer of the mask. In Zun, Masks of Submission are symbols of great shame and inferiority. Every male who knows of magic is forced to hide his face at all times with this item, after he has also been savagely castrated for his sins. Should one of them be seen breaking this rule, he would be put to death immediately, and those that do not are still treated as subhuman pariahs of lesser intrisic value even than the males of the hard-working slave caste. Still, these broken souls have some use to the Amazons: the remnants of their magic are used to lead the repulsive demons the Amazons summon for battle as well as to serve the Vestals as communion slaves."

Only very few in Zun wear that mask, but those that do are considered to be of a high rank among the slave caste and they are usually trusted with some of the least unpleasant tasks among the castrated ones'. Having been gifted with a Purpose, they are protected from harm by the law and authorized a highly monitored use of their magic. While being awarded that mask does not usually suffice in healing the mental and bodily scars that hamper its user's magical abilities, it still gives him the opportunity to do so through over means, and as such, to eventually retrieve his whole power. It also further increases his skills as a demonic overseer, but by removing the restraints on his powers stops converting them in the ability to serve as a communion slave."

This very peculiar geological formation, sacred to the Amazons of Zun, is called the Spire of Justice and towers over a vast region like the throne of a god. Its very narrow summit, covered in pure snow and only accessible by secret stairways or by flight, is an altar of utmost importance to the holy order of Vestals, who use it for their scrying and their sacrifices. Forged in pure silver and infused with the sublime light of the Sun from the summit of the Spire, the Sword of the Spire is the greatest symbol of Justice in Zun. Only given to exceptional heroines, it invests them with the sacred mission of uncompromisingly striking evil down in the name of the God. Anyone wearing this nearly perfect weapon will be permanently blessed, receive increased mastery of air magic and become as light, quick and awe-inspiring as the rays of the sun."

Imbued with these two sacred forces, that Heroine Pendant then becomes the most powerful of the Adventurer's artifacts, for it is well known that during their journeys their deeds allow them to acquire many magical items, sources of their powers. But this Pendant is special to the Garnet Adventurer in more than a way, and she could very well sacrifice her own life to ensure its safety.

#descr "The Crown of Autumn isn't a literal crown but a symbolic one and describes the golden aspect that the leaves of a tree can take when summer is over, suddenly making it more beautiful until life leaves it completely. Although this process is very common, natural and mundane; magical, sentient trees are able to intensify and sublimate its effects by focusing all their remaining lifeforce into the maturation of their own colors. When this happens, that tree's magical powers all increase very quickly until it appears to be the most noble and venerable of all trees, but this also implies surrendering to the beautiful mortality of Fall, and therefore that tree inevitably will slowly wither and die. Since this process is irreversible, this item cannot be removed from its wearer. It will disease him incurably, making him lose health and gain afflictions regularly. This very potent magic booster therefore means the untimely death of its user after a few months of agony. The sacrifice inherent in taking up the mantle also grants great authority both as a teacher and a priest in the eyes of the Birds, thus gifting him with the inspiring researcher ability or improving this ability if he already has it, and it can only be used by Treelords and Sky Trees."

Such souls naturally linger in the most ancient forests, where they act as the protector spirits of their kind and as the collective consciousness of the grove. They are normally invisible and impossible to interact with directly, but the elder roots of Sky Trees give them the knowledge of how to let the Heart of the Forest manifest to focus its benevolent influence on a single great tree by giving it a new body in the form of a very pure emerald. The user of this item, which can only be a Treelord or a Sky Tree, will become entirely immune to all the effects of diseases and will receive supernatural regenerative powers for as long as he wears it. Although this doesn't remove afflictions from the user, it does make him able to indefinitely resist the nefarious effects of the Crown of Autumn, a miracle that isn't attainable in any other way.

The most obvious one is the everlasting presence of the Guardians of Knowledge, whose armor is all but impervious to flames, and whose function is to keep a close watch over the books and their readers. But invisible magical wards also were invented for this purpose, and when a dignitary from the Scholar Citadel must leave it with important scrolls, he brings with him such protections to ensure both their safety and his own. The Scroll of Fire Immunity is the greatest protection against fire known to mankind.

Second, it allows the Vessel to bend space and time and cast the Astral Travel ritual for free, teleporting it and its whole army to any chosen destination. In addition, it is an incredibly powerful magic weapon that explodes with destructive metaphysical light in a large zone after each hit, affecting even Sophia's allies, except for non-undead mindless constructs and highly magic-resistant beings."

At first glance, this incredibly powerful artifact looks like a simple volumen, but on the surface of its scroll ever-changing convoluted writings in all known languages of the world continuously appear and disappear, revealing the glimpse of an intellectual depth comparable to that of ten thousand tomes. This indestructible volumen contains within itself the entire knowledge of the whole Ancient Library. It is so complex that, should it fall between foreign hands, it can be expected that only one out of a hundred of its secrets would be revealed - and yet, that would be enough to grant its bearer almost unlimited arcane power. If the Timeless Archive's owner is an astral mage, his power in that path shall increase tremendously for as long as it remains in his possession. In addition, due to its encyclopedic nature, it increases its owner's level in all other paths by one. Finally, thanks to the powerful magic that was used to make the Archive eternally indestructible, its user will start every battle with the immediate benefits of a Time Stop spell."

Sometimes, precious aquamarines among the ancient treasures of Argolinth are selected by the Gerousia to be carved into ornamental jewels for the Prytaneis and their most faithful heralds. They are then infused with a tremendous power only befitting their owner's rank. Their wearer is constantly blessed and his magical mastery is increased in all his known paths. In addition, he is able to bring with him a small army to protect him even under the sea and to command it with a vastly improved authority."

Although this mythic item has gone missing a long time ago and only resurfaced for short moments in history, it has never been forgotten by sciapods, as the Sophotatoi whisper that it is in fact the broken heart of U himself. While its complete story might remain a mystery forever, it is known that all foreigners that found it in the past have used it to impose their domination over U and ended up perishing crushed and buried under mountains or abysses for their greed and inability to control the stone. Now that the blemmyes have finally retrieved it, they have faith in that sign of the God and they won't let anyone repeat these tragic memories. Thus, the Cataclysmic Keystone will always be lost after its user dies in battle and will never fall in the hands of the enemy. It gives its user great resilience as well as the strength to move mountains and the ability to cause terrible earthquakes on a whim. In addition, should its user be a mage of Earth, his mastery of that path will be increased."

Although this mythic item has gone missing a long time ago and only resurfaced for short moments in history, it has never been forgotten by sciapods, for it is said to be a divine gift that led them to the discovery of the first Angel Egg. Imbued with strange properties, this small needle seems to be made of an unearthly material and at a first glance behaves like a magnet. But in truth, it isn't attracted to the North, nor to any other magnetic pole. Instead, it always points towards the closest Angel Egg, and as such the few foreign scholars that had the chance to study it called it a ''syzygistic oracle'' before they eventually lost their sanity under its eerie influence. Although prolonged use of the Gnomonic Keystone can lead to madness, at first this phenomenon is harmless and actually helps mentally coping with the surreal by giving its user some illusory understanding of it; however, the greatest of its alien powers is by far and in many ways over the dimension of time, for this object is so attuned to the celestial cycles that it can be compared to a clock. In addition to granting its user the ability to nearly stop time when in danger and strengthening him at each solstice and equinox, it also increases his mastery of Astral magic and allows him to predict and prevent half of all bad events in the province where he dwells as well as to cause baleful astral conjunctions at will over enemy provinces."

Although this mythic item has gone missing a long time ago and only resurfaced for short moments in history, it has never been forgotten by sciapods, as it is said to have belonged to the first and greatest Sophotatos of all times. According to ancient lore, from his limitless fascination for fire he found the will to overcome his limitations and become a pyromancer, and thus he opened up the way to magic for the sciapod generations to come. Eventually, he even captured a spark from the end of the previous world and learned how to turn entire lands to ash with a single gesture. But one day, when his loved ones needed his help, he discovered much too late that he was unable to bring anything but destruction upon them. In the end, his emotional struggling was so intense that he spontaneously consumed himself in a burst of flames and with his last breath imbued his keystone with both his love and his suffering. Since then, all its users have brought irreparable ruin both over their enemies and themselves. In addition to granting its user with cataclysmic control over fire, the Ekpyrotic Keystone transforms everything it burns into magical ashes that can be converted into one true Earth gem per month. Allowing Sophotatos pyromaniacs to touch it might also give them new insights."

While its true nature is unknown and its history shrouded in mystery, it is always when the cannibalistic practices of sciapods were at their apex that it reappeared, and every time it brought great devastation both to U and its enemies. While the Nephritic Keystone can be used to preserve life and protect it from everything that is nocive, thus making its user immune to poisons and diseases, by doing so it doesn't destroy evil but rather displaces it, thus causing illness to others. In turn, this great power can be exploited either corrupt the earth and gain control over its ill progeny, or to spread death in the very air, causing great agony in battle to both allies and foes. In addition, should the one who possesses it be a Blood mage, his magic skills will be increased - which makes it a real treasure to Anthropophagoi and the monsters they summon."

As such, more ancient than the sciapod race itself, this relic is speculated to still bear the very soul of those primordial giants that shared it as a tool of procreation and inseminated the world with it. Capable of anchoring lost souls to matter and to reincarnate them, it is a powerful catalyst for spontaneous generation and brings growth and prosperity to the whole province in which it is located. In addition, its powers can be used to entangle many targets in wild vines as well as to increase its user's mastery of Nature magic, and every month sprouts from its crevices one magical seed which can be used as a gem of Nature by anyone who possesses it. But its greatest power is by far to cause its bearer to be reborn if killed in combat, which will also cause the Palingenesic Keystone to be lost once again."

But by using magically enhanced flint stones and other primitive tools, they can overcome that handicap and equal humans in that discipline. Since greater blemmyes don't need them to reach the same expertise as humans, stone tools can only be used by sophotatoi and lesser blemmyes, excluding Satraps, who never do manual labor. In addition, their effect can be combined with that of classical dwarven hammers."

#descr "Ioun Stones are small pebbles of various geometrical shapes and colors made of a strange permanently levitating material which is very sought out by mages and scholars of the whole world for its mystical properties. Whenever a Ioun Stone touches the skin of a conscious being, it becomes attuned to that being and starts orbiting his head, thus vastly improving his cognitive abilities - which translates into increased research capacity, magic resistance and magic penetration. Since blemmyes completely lack a head, most can't make any use of them, but due to their generally round shape and higher mental potential this is not the case of Thinking Protozoons, and for that reason they are often forced to harness the power of Ioun Stones in order to enhance their abilities in service of the Tribes. Furthermore, sharing these traits with Thinking Protozoons, Eye Tyrants can use items of that sort as well, and they don't hesitate to do so when they feel the need to enhance their already superior intelligence. While they can also be used by most non-blemmye researchers and sorcerers, sadly it is extremely hard for humans to obtain Ioun Stones due to the fact that they are very rare outside of U and a few other places. Even though their true origins are unknown, it is often speculated that Ioun Stones are somehow linked to blemmyes by nature, and sometimes even to Angel Eggs and the advent of Mu."

It takes the shape of a blazing halo of mystical letters that can be read in many different ways, each describing another of the holy names of the Lord. By receiving the grace of bearing it, a Seraph can become a Voice of Eternity and as such permanently gain incredibly powerful inspiring researcher, priestly and magical skills. Thus blessed with Divine Wisdom, the Crown of Names' bearer will greatly support all friendly researchers in the province and himself receive immensely amplified arcane power, inevitably taking an instrumental part in Heaven's ultimate victory. With his incomparably increased sacred authority, he will also become able to cast the Sephira of Eternity ritual, a feat otherwise almost unattainable."

Although unlike those produced by the Sephira of Wisdom its everchanging symbols are meaningless to the eyes, the Crown of Rhymes does follow a logic of its own: instead of communicating a spark of the Infinite through syllables and words, it does so through musical and arithmetical rhythms. As such, its primeval pulses are reminiscent of the ten successive waves of Tzimtzum, repeating themselves like fractals in an unlimited number of ways both visually and through the soft tintinnabulation of notes seemingly played in perfect symbiosis by eighteen unearthly musicians. Also unlike the Crown of Names, the Crown of Rhymes doesn't directly draw its power from the God; instead, it unlocks the inner potential of its bearer - necessarily a Tetramorph - by unraveling its bounds fourfold and by revealing its own essential connection to Ein Sof. As a consequence, its user's arcane skills will be vastly increased regardless of their current aspect."

As such, it completely ignores protection of all kinds and it mercifully forces its foes to return to eternal rest, even if the victims would normally benefit from immortality.

The first layer is a physical barrier of great effectiveness, akin to that provided by an artifact. The second layer is a mental barrier which strengthens the mind and limits the grasp of hostile magic against the wielder. The third layer is a barrier of astral energies which blast unconscious the minds of whoever touches them. The fourth layer is an ontological barrier which alters the fate of attackers by inflicting them with temporary cursed luck in battle. And the last layer is a metaphysical barrier which marks their souls for eternal doom by attracting to them the attention of the horrors of the void. Empyreal Shields are unbearable to evil entities and cannot be wielded by undead beings or demons."

In truth, this so-called Crown of Eyes isn't a separate entity but rather an extraordinary emanation of its bearer's metaphysical substance and a direct extension of its sentience and will which appears when the God of Bethel She'em has elected it as its holy herald above all except Seraphs and Tetramorphs. As a result, the crowned Domination or Throne will be invested with vastly superior arcane powers in the form of a dread-inspiring aura, impenetrable magic resistance, nearly limitless stamina and the ability to cast several spells at once with a single thought."

#selectnation 5 -- EA Arcoscephale
#name "Arcoscephale"
#epithet "Golden Era"
#descr "The kingdom of Arcoscephale is yet to be founded and in its place is a loose collection of city states. Bronze is more common than iron and hoplites have yet to see the light of day. Instead, myrmidons and chariots compose the core of the armies. In this time, slaves are commonly used and most free men have plenty of time to spend on fine arts and good living. Philosophers gather in the cities to discuss esoteric truths and engineers manufacture clever contraptions for civil or military use. At the heart of Arcoscephale lies Mount Cephalos, abode of the Awakening God. At the foot of the mountain is a great temple where sacred Pegasus Riders are trained. Icarids, men with mechanical wings, are also used in warfare. The philosophers are better at magical research in a slothful Dominion."
#summary "Race: Humans
Military: Heavy infantry, chariots, flying infantry, sacred Pegasus Riders, engineers
Magic: Nature, Astral, Elements. Philosopher researchers
Priests: Weak, healing. Sceptic preachers (reduces Dominion). Prophet will receive divine insights from the stars and become a very powerful Astral mage.
Dominion: Scry (accurate and automatic military reports inside dominion)"
#brief "An ancient human kingdom led by Philosophers, Arcoscephale mainly uses heavy infantry, chariots and flying Icarids. The Philosophers are skilled researchers. Oreiads, roaming mountain spirits, and Mystics skilled in Astral and Elemental magic give Arcoscephale great magical versatility. The priestesses of Arcoscephale can heal wounded soldiers."

#descr "Ermor is an empire centered around a great city. For centuries it has grown and become more and more influential. Traders and travelers from near and far come to the city. By military campaigns, diplomacy and trade, Ermor has become a power to be reckoned with. By adopting local traditions and beliefs, the Ermorians posed little threats to neighbors and conquered peoples, but this has begun to change. A new God is rising. Old syncretistic faiths and spirit worship were banned by a Prophet dressed in white shrouds. The remnants of his body and shrouds are buried in the Holy City of Eldregate where the adherents of the New Faith are awaiting the arrival of the Reawakening God foreseen by the Prophet. The all-encompassing old state-cult of the Numinas still survives, but the Pontifices and Flamen are slowly adopting the New Faith."
#summary "Race: Human.
Military: Human legionnaires with skilled cavalry, lizard auxiliaries. Starts the game with three legions.
Magic: All paths except Blood. Primarily Fire, Death and Astral. A major doctrinal path can be decreted for the empire's destiny, unlocking new sacred troops, mages, spells and mechanics.
Priests: Powerful, can heal afflictions."
#brief "Ermor is a human empire centered around a great city. The Empire has just recently converted to the New Faith and its magical skills are very versatile as mage-priests from the Old Faith still linger."
-- Can proclaim Pax Ermora in conquered capitals to absorb some of the local elites.

The tribes have a long history of war and infighting, but recent developments have joined the tribes in pursuit of a single goal. The most prominent tribes of the Confederacy are the Marverni, the Ambibates, the Eponi and the Carnutes. The Sequani, though a small tribe, are influential due to the large number of Druids among them. The smiths of the Marverni tribe are reputedly the inventors of chainmail and most nobles of the tribes use it. Lowborn warriors fight bare-chested. Both wear tattoos with dormant magical powers. The Ambibates are known for their martial skills. The Eponi nobles fight on horseback and are the only cavalry available to the nation. The Carnute tribe guards the Sacred Forest of Carnutes where the Druids gather every year. The Carnute warriors are able to go berserk when wounded. Boars are a sacred symbol of the Marverni nation."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Light and medium infantry, medium cavalry. Every fully controlled fort province with friendly dominion, at least five non-sacred national troops of the same type and a commander of the appropriate tribe will be joined by an additional warrior of that type every other month for free. This effect stacks for each different unit type.
Magic: Earth, Astral, some Nature and Water. Sacred communions can summon the power of thunder.
Priests: Medium, can perform blood sacrifices"
#brief "Marverni is a nation of tribal chiefdoms led by Druids, powerful readers of the stars and the Earth. Most warriors fight bare-chasted, but noble warriors use chainmail armor. Gutuaters adorn the warriors with magical tattoos."

#descr "Sauromatia is a nation of nomadic warrior tribes ruled by women. Men and women fight side by side and all prominent tribes are ruled by warrior queens. This is a legacy of the Sauromatians merging with the Amazon tribes in times past. The Amazons leaders were not accepted, because they were not warriors, but they influenced the Sauromatians and women warriors gained power and prestige. Only the tribe of the Androphags has totally rejected the notion of female leadership. The Androphags are led by ancient Witch Kings who introduced cannibalism and man-flaying to the Sauromatians. The Androphags also use Hydras from the Marshes of Pythia in warfare."
#summary "Military: Light and medium cavalry, serpent riders, lizard riders, hydras.
Magic: Strong Death, medium Nature, Blood and Water, weak Astral.
Priests: Weak. Can perform blood sacrifice. Witch Kings can cast the Ophidian Blood battle spell for a gem, blessing even non-sacred beings in a small area around themselves but inflicting targets with tremendous Poison damage.
Dominion: Gives fully controlled provinces 8 percent chance per Death scale per month to generate 2d3 gems of mostly Nature."
#brief "Sauromatia is a tribal nation ruled by women. Swift raiders and lancers form the backbone of the armies. Amazon warriors and Androphags are the sacred elites of the Sauromatians. Witch Kings, masters of dark sorcery, rule the Androphag tribe. Hydras from the Pythian Marsh are tamed and used in warfare."

Their flesh radiates heat and they are not harmed by flames. Abysians are stronger than humans and use very heavy armor and weaponry. Bows are not used, as they would burn to cinders in the glowing hands of the Abysians. The war machine of Abysia also includes salamanders, lizard-like beings composed of the same hot lava-born flesh as the Abysians. The Anointed of Rhuax and the Anathemant priests of the Flame Cult practice blood sacrifice to strengthen the power of the Awakening God. The Warlocks of the Smouldercone, a magical order which has existed for centuries but is still young and recent comparatively to the ancient Abysian kingdom, practice Blood magic in the name of the Anointed Ones and search for suitable blood slaves in conquered lands; their dark experiments to control the flesh of humans as arcane-bound slaves and to allow it to resist the harsh volcanic climate of their lands has given birth to the Amazons of the Garnet Tribe, one of their most famous achievements, but they have accomplished many much greater feats since then and are now moving on to preparing the conquest of the sunlit world. Abysians prefer to live in extremely hot places and spread the hellscape of their native environment wherever they are allowed to prosper. They do not farm or hunt for a living, so their income or supplies are not affected much by the Growth or Death scales of a province. However, population will still die slowly in Abysian-controlled provinces with Death scales."

In ancient times, there were three Caelian clans led by semi-divine beings known as Yazatas: the Kavi, the Airyas and the Mairyas. But the Mairyas of the Raptor clan were led astray by the wicked Mainyus and Daevas. Together, they tainted the purifying flame and Catharsis became Anthrax, King of Banefires. As a result the Daevas as well as the Yazatas were banished from this world and a civil war broke out between the Raptor clan of Raven's Vale and the Airyas of High Caelum. But when the empire was on the brink of annihilation due to fratricidal war, some Yazatas reemerged from hiding and brought peace and unity to the three Caelian tribes. The returned Yazatas were crowned as the divine Eagle Kings of all Caelum and the Raptor clan was accepted even though it was held responsible for the corruption of Catharsis. Although some traitors were unhappy with the Eagle Kings' justice and left to build the exiled realms of Ragha and Hararat in distant lands, most Caelians are enthousiastic at the prospect of working together towards a prosperous future under their divine rulers' guidance. Now, their vast and ancient empire is growing back to its former glory and soon it will reclaim the rightful ownership of the neighboring kingdoms, thus ending all heresies and bringing true civilization to the neighboring pagan people such as Arcoscephale's underdeveloped city-states, Hinnom's barbarian wastelands and Bandar Log's primitive rainforests in the name of the One, Greater Good.

But in time their slaves rebelled and, with the gods' interference, the Aboleths had no choice but to retreat and hide where even the light couldn't reach them. For innumerable millenia, they have lurked silently and carefully conspired in the dark to once again assert their sovereignty upon that which is rightfully theirs and has been stolen from them by the surface-dwellers: everything. Having gradually infiltrated mortal nations, they have secretly used their powers of domination and with each passing century enslaved more and more servitors to do the daily work and fill up the ranks of their armies, slowly rebuilding their forgotten realm. In a deep gorge the enslaved workers have built a score of small but magnificent cities for their rulers.

The Gigantes of Phlegra had powerful ancestors, who in the ancient times made war upon the Pantokrator. Punished for their sins, their descendants no longer appear as proud hoplites in gleaming armor, unlike their cousins of Mekone, who abstained and watched, waiting for a better opportunity. Instead, they are deformed and cursed with a violent temper, and now both giant kinds hate and despise each other for what they have become. Since the fall of their kingdom, Phlegran Gigantes resent pretending gods and religious faiths, and only the human population of the kingdom devote themselves to the awakening God. Phlegra is also the home of the sheep-herding Cyclopes, another tribe of giants. Full of anger and bitterness for having failed to rule the whole world, the Gigantes of Phlegra have instead enslaved their weak neighbors and formed a kingdom under the rule of their Tyrants.
Unscrupulous human mages have developed ways to serve the Tyrants by dominating less fortunate magically adept humans. Now human taskmasters and Oppressors cause more fear in the populace than the Tyrants themselves."
#brief "Phlegra is a kingdom of Gigantes that were cursed for rebelling against the Pantokrator. Now, like their hated Mekonean cousins, who despise them, they are willing to take their revenge by once again declaring war upon the gods of men.

Most of the population is made up of enslaved humans, but it is divided and unscrupulous individuals serve the tyrants in exchange for power."

#descr "Phaeacia is an island queendom of dark-skinned men of great stature, the Colossi. Once a colony of Berytos, the island flourished and became rich and influential, known for its traders, craftsmen and marvelous shipwrights. But then, a great war broke out between Berytos and Arcoscephale, and due to its remote location Phaeacia was cut off from the mainland. It is only thanks to ample tributes and its natural defenses that Phaeacia was able to stave off the conquerors and avoid annihilation. With that relative peace the wheel of fate soon turned and, encouraged by Arcoscephale, Phaeacia's regents were quick to embrace the war's opportunity to declare their independence and the beginning of a new ruling dynasty. When the war ended, it was too late for Berytos, as it had lost Phaeacia's wealth and fealty. Under the jealous and far away eyes of its new rivals, the queendom has since grown in power and influence. Its traders and explorers have traveled to the far reaches of the world and brought one of the world's greatest marvels to Phaeacia, a sapling of the golden tree of the blessed garden of the Hesperides. Now most of Phaeacia's inhabitants live unnaturally long and blissful lives detached from the strife of the world beyond their island.
Phaeacia is also the home to giants exiled from Mekone. When the first preparations for the Gigantes' futile war upon gods began more than a century ago, some Gigantes sensed the inevitability of its disastrous end and did not join the God-slayer. They instead hid in Black Korkyra, an inhospitable isle of the Phaeacian archipelago. The king of the Gigantes married the Colossi queen of Phaeacia and their daughters have ruled the island ever since. Most nobles of the island trace a legacy to the Gigantes of Mekone as well as to the Berytian Colossi and the Great Race of Mababwe, but a few of the pure blooded Gigantes also remain on Black Korkyra. Upholding the old bargain they arrive each spring to pledge the queen their allegiance."

At the confluence of so many cultures, the cosmopolitan people of Delphanes welcomes priests of every faith and adopts their beliefs within their own syncretic system. The Sibyls do not interfere with that fact and simply consider the lesser gods as mere aspects of the Great One. But now, he is awakening, and with him a great thirst for total spiritual dominance and perfect unity. The Sibyls and the heavily armed and disciplined guardians of their holy city are now rising as a new force, and along with their mystical followers from the close lands of Bandar Log and beyond, they are preparing for vast conquests in the name of the Master of All.

Its history is long and intrically connected to that of C'tis, whose vast and fertile lands include most of the valley downstream and are populated by the same species of lizardmen. In the ancient times, Aabydum was a great empire and controlled the whole valley, ruling over all lizardmen. But after a great civil war the Old Dynasty had to retreat in the desert while the victorious bastard-princes of the newborn kingdom of C'tis replaced it on the throne. Isolated and powerless, Aabydum was soon to be forgotten by most, even though all C'tissians remain proud of its lingering glory as a mysterious echo of their own past. In time, the Old Dynasty of Aabydum died out and a New Dynasty had to take its place in order to preserve the sacred bloodlines, faithfully protecting the secret sepultures of their forefathers and patiently leading the kingdom to its eventual renewal.
In the days of yore, the High Priests and enigmatic Sauromancers of Aabydum - great mages of death and rebirth whose secretive Order, older than C'tis itself, is considered sacred in Aabydum only - mastered the craft of embalming to preserve the remains of their kings. Thus, since the dawn of the kingdom, tombs have been constructed by these great builders and monarchs to contain their mummified relics as well as those of their priests and servants. But recently, through studies of ancient lore, the Sauromancers have perfected the dark rituals that awaken the kings of old to lead the stirring dead as the Desert Kings, highest priests of Aabydum, lead the kingdom of the living at the top of society. And now, with the Awakening of the God and as foreseen in his Seventh Book, Aabydum and its half-divine sovereigns are finally re-emerging from their millenary slumber beyond the veils of death."
#brief "Aabydum is a very ancient kingdom that ruled over the lizardmen long before the rise of C'tis. Down to a single temple-citadel built in the desert to protect the secret tombs where the mummified kings of its Old Dynasty were buried, it is but a shadow of its formerly glorious, nearly forgotten empire. But now, led by the Sacred, One True Order of Sauromancers, the priest-kings of the New Dynasty and their reanimated ancestors, the faithful of Aabydum are preparing for a great renewal."

Half of the population are half-blooded Abysian descendants from the isolated colony of Tur and half are Airyan refugees who reject the rule of the Eagle Kings. Tur was a distant and prosperous Abysian colony founded after a successful military campaign against the ancient Yazad empire of Caelum. But the war with the Yazatas had been taxing and the colony was cut off from the kingdom by a campaign of Hinnom through the fertile lands previously conquered from Caelum. For centuries Tur was left alone as the Yazatas too were warring for greater stakes, even facing daring Arcoscephalean incursions. Thus an independent kingdom formed in the forgotten principality. Then at last came the Caelians. A great host of iceclad warriors descended upon the Turan armies on the plain of Ragha in the mid of winter. The Turan Shah realized that Tur could not stand up to the Caelians for long. Tur was on the brink of destruction when the attacks suddenly stopped. Civil war with the Daevas had broken out in Caelum and the campaign was aborted. Instead Caelian refugees and deserters fleeing the demonic onslaughts settled on the plain of Ragha. Airyan Seraphs approached the Turan Shah and peace was negotiated. When after the Celestial Yazatas' banishment the Eagle Kings replaced them, they sent their followers to demand control of Tur. The exiled Caelians refused to recognize these fallen Yazatas as divine emperors and in response to this schism their former brothers attacked once more, only for the exiled ones to be saved by the gryphon riders of Tur. This sealed the truce and a strange alliance was formed. Ragha is now a society of two peoples united out of necessity. During winter the Airyas reign and during summer the Turans reign. Even faith has evolved to mimic the legacy of the two peoples. Two different groups of beings are adored and worshipped. But this is starting to change as the One True God has arisen."

Having previously made war upon the gods of men, the Phlegran Gigantes who once ruled the land were punished for their sins, imprisoned and cursed with monstrous appearance. Those who avoided imprisonment became Tyrants and conquerors of many lands including Porphyrion and formed a slave kingdom with the aid of human servants. But taking advantage of the Tyrants' petty conflicts and tendency to destroy each other along with the very lands they rule, their Porphyrian thralls eventually rebelled, humans and Cyclopes uniting against them to retrieve their freedom. This triggered a terrible war which required innumerable sacrifices and, in the midst of pain and chaos, the people's immediate need for strength and order tragically gave birth to a new elite of human Oppressor mages that all but replaced the old tyrants.
For centuries now, the giants have been absent and only memories of their tyranny remain; but most of the Porphyrian population still is dominated by cruel masters, human Oppressors protected by a warrior caste of Cyclopes who previously lived pastoral lives just like their Phlegran cousins still do, but eventually became ruthless soldiers and guardians of the oligarchy, gladly serving the Oppressors in exchange for privileges. Yet, the black mountain of Ethna near the city of Porphyrion has always been emitting strange fumes and fires, and it is believed that dreadful Gigantes even greater and mightier than the Tyrants of old have been imprisoned below it in forgotten times; thus, the people still lives in great fear not only of the Gigantes' return but also of their godlike Laestrygonian fathers' awakening, and the Oppressors have been using that fear to justify their rule, claiming that they alone can prevent such a terrible event, building a cult to appease their wrath and hoping that the sleeping giants never wake up indeed."

And there along with it suddenly appeared a new and enigmatic empire, built overnight from remnants of the great race of the Star which had survived the Fall, and at first hidden but already prosperous and promised to a great destiny.
Apparently unnoticed, they quickly adapted and multiplied, secretly enslaving through sheer strength of mind the primitive fishlike humanoids they encountered under the sea.

A former Arcoscephalian colony of Therodian descent and the Pelagian colony of Erytheia, the Red Land, were joined through marriage. But then, the Triton Kings of the deeps fell into a carefully planned trap from the scheming Aboleths, and because of these dark intrigues civil war between them eventually broke out. Soon, the mermen became but a tool of a privileged minority of Tritons, and while the latter ones battled in the seas, many among the former ones withdrew and formed a new kingdom of mermen, Tritons and humans in Erytheia. Since then, the Triton principalities of Pelagia have united once again, but the mermen no longer form the majority of their people and their traditions and legacy are now carried on by the mystics of the Red Land. Under the independent rule of the mermen ‘Kings of Both Worlds' the former colony thrived and expanded on land and in the seas, just as did its rivalry with Pelagia. Now Erytheia is a coastal kingdom with some under-water provinces governed by a marginalized Triton nobility unable to visit the high court of the merman king. The Tritons resent the current situation and some fear this might lead to another civil war or to Pelagian intervention. Triton nobles and generals of Erytheia have started to gather armies to reclaim the deeps once theirs to gain wealth, or fiefdoms, or simply to prove their worth to the Kings of Both Worlds. Armed with powerful weapons forged according to ingenious Arcoscephalian and unearthed Therodian design, Erytheia's military is very advanced and has kindled the mystics' interest in Telkhine lore from before the great flood, their ancestry promising them some ways to rediscover the fallen empire's old secrets."

It was once a colony of Pelagia but it took its independence and now has interests in both Arcoscephalian traditions and Telkhine secrets.

#name "Makedon"
#era 1
#epithet "Sons of Heroes"
#descr "Far north of the city states of Arcoscephale there is a harsh land covered in dense forests and mountain highlands where barbarian tribes have warred since time immemorial. This land of turmoil and conflict has bred a rigid society of clan alliegance and martial excellence to repel invading tribes and warring kingdoms. However, a new warrior-elite of mounted horsemen and citizen hoplites have brought order to this fragmented land, which they now name Makedon after their clan's mythical semi-divine progenitor. After many tribal wars and skirmishes against the nascent kingdom, the Makedonians struck a final blow to the tribal confederation of Kaeonia which grew to oppose their expansion. To consolidate their influence and gain support of the many clans after the subjugation of Kaeonia, they also established a cult of heroes for powerful warrior-mages of the kingdom to pledge their swords to the awakening god, and prove their divine parentage through martial prowess. Under their influence, the many tribes of the north have finally gathered under a dynastic kingship. By the power of lance and blade each of the tribes has been subjugated and serves now in the royal army, providing skirmish and cavalry support to a core of Makedonian infantry."
#summary "Race: Strong melee and skirmish infantry backed up by capable warrior mages.
Military: Light and medium hoplites, peltasts, slingers, and light cavalry. Sacred hoplites and skilled cavalry.
Magic: Strong Air, Earth, with Astral, Nature. Minor Fire and Water access.
Priests: Medium. Members of the hero-cult and sacred band administer lower-level sacraments, but with experience in battle they may gain holy and magic levels."
#brief "The many tribes to the north of Arcoscephale have finally gathered under the dynastic kingship of Makedon, a nation ruled by a warrior-aristocracy of battlemages who embody the heroes of old. By the power of lance and blade each of the tribes has been subjugated and serves now in the royal army, providing skirmish and cavalry support to a core of Makedonian infantry."

#descr "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Thalamanth is the birth place of all Amazon Tribes and is still home to the Crystal Tribe. In some ancient yet never-forgotten era, the philosopher-kings of Thalamanth lived soft lives in their marble palaces, spending all their time thinking and pleasing themselves, until they learnt of blood magic and formed an orgiac cult. When in their hubris they threatened to corrupt the very fabric of the celestial spheres, a civil war broke out to cast them down from their thrones. Since then, it is not the men who rule in Thalamanth, but the women, for men are weak and only women know of true purity. While many left to found new cities on better grounds, the Crystal Tribe stayed so that the same crimes would never be allowed again, and they now consider themselves sacred warrior guardians of the Crystal Ark, an artifact that existed since the dawn of time and could be used to corrupt the heavens once more. The Horse Tribe nomads that fought the tyrants alongside them in the past have adopted some of their traditions, started worshipping the birds and renamed themselves the Wind Tribe to reflect that. Loving freedom too much to ever stay in a single place, they rarely meddle with the Amazons' society, so the two groups maintain good relations and their male chieftains are tolerated. More recently, a new monastic order has been formed in Thalamanth by spiritual sky mages that came from the Far East, bringing with them new beliefs but also precious gifts and signs of deep respect. After long deliberation, the Pythias agreed with the foretellings that led the Cloud Sages there and accepted them provided that they live humbly in the mountains. While they focus on thought like the banished philosophers of old, their task only serves the people of Thalamanth, and since they have succeeded in gaining its trust and love through their prowesses, they are slowly becoming recognized as an important though esoteric part of the kingdom."
#brief "Thalamanth is a matriarchal theocracy born of the union of the Amazon warriors and priestesses of the Crystal Tribe, some nomadic Horse Tribe clans that renamed themselves the Wind Tribe, and an order of eastern wandering air mages from the mountains called the Cloud Sages. Together, they worship the Sky and all that resides within it, birds and stars alike."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Wind Tribe archers, cavalry and initiates. Many sacred Amazon troops, including archers and pegasus riders.
Magic: Very powerful Air, moderate Astral, some Earth. Huge Blood bonus in the capital, but no easy access to Blood magic. All female mages and pretenders can wear Amazon Jewels, a cheap, potent spellbooster.
Priests: Powerful, heal afflictions. Temples produce Air gems. Three summonable demi-gods. Blood hunting may cause sacred units to desert."

#descr "Centuries ago, angry against the Telkhines and their blasphemous crimes, the Pantokrator submerged the ancient kingdom of Therodos under terrifying floods and earthquakes. While most inhabitants died and were refused their place in the afterlife, a semi-divine hero called Trilios survived thanks to chance, fate, ingeniosity, and the love a hidden or imprisoned God had for him and his future legacy. Trilios then reassembled some of the survivors of the cataclysm and became their king. Together, they built on the hills of Dardanum a great city called Triliax after him, and since then, his descendants have revered the sea that had spared him and the mountain that had saved him. Soon, as the proud Triliaxians grew in strength, they had to wage many wars against their neighbors. So that the marvels of civilization and craftsmanship could exist in these unexplored lands, they had to impose themselves upon the untamed Amazons of Sauromatia and the wild forces of Pangaea; and after the newly founded city-state proved its incredible resilience and ability to execute elaborate strategies, its old brothers Arcoscephale and Berytos soon became its rivals, which they still are to this day. But while Triliax was on the brink of extinction against a great alliance formed by its jealous enemies, the Pantokrator suddenly disappeared and the Awakening God manifested itself to once again save the legacy of Trilios by raising huge walls of gold around the city. Since then, Triliax has been called the Divine Citadel, and its sacred fortifications are reputed as unassailable and worshipped like a divinity in their own right. Its noble kings - the Basilei - now rule over the City with an iron fist, holding between their hands the wrath of the mountain, the sea, and the gargantuan brood of the God that gave them their power. It is only a matter of time before they start the conquest of the lands and depths alike in the name of the master of Waves, Quakes and Monsters."
#brief "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Triliax is a magnificent citadel which was given holy walls by its God and is reputed as unassailable. Its great kings are priests of the sea, the mountain, and their monstrous creatures, the brood of the Awakening God. Only by conquering the depths of the ocean will they unlock their whole legacy."
#summary "Race: Humans and cyclopes.
Military: Heavy infantry, archers, centaur slaves and chariots, sacred cyclopes in coastal forts with a cyclops commander, sea trolls in underwater forts. Aristocrats increase province defense. Summonable forts.
Magic: Powerful Water and Earth, weak Fire and Air. Talented mage-smiths. Physicist scholars help in sieges. Recruitable Troll Archons produce water gems. Powerful summonable monsters, some only underwater.
Priests: Powerful."

#descr "It is said that, in the ancient times, the gods created the birds to serve them as serfs and messengers. They gave them their wings, wit and singing so that mortals more humble and pure than men could worship them and attend to their needs. Thus, led by the most natural of impulses, the race of birds thrived in simplicity and innocence, and alone was allowed to freely come and go through the celestial gates. But one day, the Pantokrator vanished, and greedy souls turned their eyes towards his thrones. Among them, Pistheas, an exiled arcoscephalian who knew of the birds' origins and how to speak their tongue, tried to assemble them to show them the truth - that they no longer had a master - and to convince them that it was time for them to take what was rightfully theirs. Thus, his revolutionary idea started to make its way among the birds: the idea of a great city half-way to the stars, the ideal Nephelococcygia, free both from the sins of men and the arrogance of the gods, that would catch for the newly formed Nation of the Birds all the ascending sacrifical fumes from the earth, so that they would never reach the gods, letting the birds be worshipped in their place. This idea quickly became a goal, and soon after, a reality. Innumerable bird tribes united their efforts to build their new home in the clouds, guided by the wisdom of their older, sentient homes: the sacred, immaculate Sky Trees. When at last the wondrous undertaking was finished, Pistheas came back to the birds and asked them to be their king. Again, his idea journeyed from forest to mountaintop, until the collective mind of the birds decided that he was just like the men from whom he was hiding: power-hungry and manipulative, a liar that only wanted to steal away their hard work and freedom. He was shredded to pieces and his murderers swore that never again a non-bird mortal would be allowed to set foot upon the floor of Nephelococcygia. And from this day on, neither man nor god could stop them."
#brief "In very recent times, a revolution started among the wild bird tribes of the world. Many among them united into a single Nation of the Birds and joined their efforts to steal divinity from the gods and build the wondrous city of Nephelococcygia among the clouds, where inferior humanoid and non-winged mortals are not allowed to dwell. While they are chaotic animals and despise technology, they find precious help in the mystical wisdom of their Sky Tree guides."
#summary "Race: Regular albeit clever wild birds. No technology.
Military: Physically weak with low morale, but flying, airshielded, stealthy, cheap and available in forests and mountains. Halved upkeeps, low recruitment point costs.
Magic: Air, Nature, some Astral. Weak, except for Sky Trees, immobile summons that provide gems and are very resilient. Items are costlier and harder to equip, but there still are many national ones.
Priests: Weak, animal only, can blood sacrifice. Dominion spreads turmoil."

#descr "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Isphenople was born from a long history of conflict between other nations. Originally a c'tissian temple-city named Isphi, it was the center of cultural exchanges with Arcoscephale, and many philosophers came here to learn from the sauromancers, whose mystical order had an important presence in the region. But then, war broke out between C'tis and the young empire of Ermor, and soon Isphi became the Emperor's property. Impressed by the wisdom of the scholars that now lived under his rule, he undertook a great project: the foundation of a Library so vast and complete that it would supplant Arcoscephale as the world's capital of knowledge. In a way, he succeeded: as its collection of intellectual masterworks grew, the renascent Isphenople attracted more and more erudites from all over the world, in turn bringing even more rare books to its shelves, and so on. But with time, wars, diplomatic intrigues and political schemes, as each day it became more cosmopolitan, Isphenople gained in independence just as in influence, and one day it became clear that nothing could be done to prevent its emancipation. So instead of using force against it, the judicious Emperor generously gifted it with freedom, thus ensuring for some time a useful relation of friendship with it, and it did not take long for other nations to adopt a similar attitude. Since then, decades have passed, and, led by the Conclave - a secluded council of peer-elected savants -, the Scholar Citadel cemented its priviliged position as a strictly neutral city-state that pursues only one goal: universal knowledge. Although a facade of friendship has been preserved until now between Isphenople and its neighbors, jealousy for its secrets is flourishing, and a climate of uncertainty is pushing the Conclave to action. Now, with the Pantokrator gone, the doors have opened to unveiling the Ultimate Mystery, and the Conclave won't let anyone stop its Gnostic ascension."
#brief "A sanctuary to those that seek the Truth, Isphenople is the greatest library of the world. There, sages and scholars of all origins join their efforts to build an encyclopedic knowledge of the universe by constantly gathering more ancient scrolls and tomes of great science. While its territory is small and its military weak, it firmly retains its independence from other nations, and soon its relentless research for hidden lore shall become the Gnostic worship of a Divine Mystery."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Heavy infantry, ranged mystics, magical statues. Huge, sacred juggernauts that spread dominion but are built very slowly.
Magic: High Astral, medium Earth. Unreliable access to all paths, sometimes high. Cheap construction rituals. Very high research. Access to all score graphs.
Priests: Generally weak, but a few are very strong. Temples produce astral pearls."

#descr "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Arcadeia is a peaceful, pastoral country of simple shepherds and rhapsodes hidden in the paradise-like slopes and vales of the sacred Mount Ida, where benevolent spirits of nature have lived alongside mortals for centuries. Although it is almost uncivilized, it is renowned for the sweetness of its fruits and the softness of its weather, and more than one traveler has lost the will to go on after having found these wild, blissful lands. Of course, not even such a beautiful place is free from suffering; 'et in Arcadeia ego', as the old Ermorian saying goes: death and evil are never far, even where health and pleasure seem to reside. But those that inhabit the blessed lands of Arcadeia prefer to stay oblivious to this reality until the very end, and to live carefree, innocent, hedonistic lives as dancers, poets and free-thinkers under the captivating tutelage of their leaders and protectors, the immortal nymphs of Mount Ida. Thus, as untamed as they are humble, the sons and daughters of the legendary Pandora shall always refuse Arcoscephale's and Ermor's way of life, and although they despise war as much as work, with the help of their Awakening God, they'll take up arms if necessary to defend their freedom and the inviolate purity of the nymphs' sanctuaries."
#brief "Arcadeia is a peaceful and fertile land where humans and nymphs live alongside each other, free from tyranny, following a simple and pastoral way of life far from civilization. Almost a paradise on earth, it is a place of harmony between man and nature, where work is prohibited and poetry sacred. But a dark secret sleeps below the earth and may shatter Arcadeia's innocence forever..."
#summary "Race: Humans that prefer sloth scales, powerful nymphs. Weak military.
Magic: High Nature, Earth and Air, some Water and Fire. Auloniad mages recruitable anywhere. Powerful summonable mages and units, some recruitable in underwater forts as well.
Priests: Powerful. Cheap rhapsode priests recruitable anywhere even without temples. Temples allow for recruitment of sacred or free troops as well as Anthousiad healers that increase sloth, order, growth, fortune and magic scales."

#descr "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Nabatem is a small but ancient matriarchal kingdom that few have seen with their very eyes, but nonetheless known for its violent slavers and mysterious riches. It is not clearly remembered how it came to be, but it is believed that several centuries ago three Amazon Tribes were exiled from the citadel of their origins or willingly left due to a disagreement with their sisters. One of those Tribes, the Onyx Tribe, that Wanted to Destroy Which That is Weak, departed through the mountains and then dispersed in several directions, before one of its remnants, lost without divine leadership, received a sign from heaven in the form of a falling star. Following it towards the South, the Amazons progressively saw the ridges changing, becoming warmer, redder and drier, and soon reached steep gorges of ochre that sinuously went deeper and deeper under unknown sands, protecting them from the sun and letting them hear the soft, singing echo of a hidden creek. When they finally found in these narrow cliffs a vast cave network and an oasis that promised them shelter from monsters, men and the desert, they already knew that this was to become their new home; but this was only confirmed further when they retrieved the Fallen Star. It was a huge black, cubic stone, a Baetyl, and it whispered of an Awakening God and dark paths Below. Under its advice, the soon to be Carved City of Saqaba was founded, its gates and temples directly sculpted in the surrounding chasms, and after a short war against the savage Troglodytes that lived here, the Onyx Tribe started exploring the crevasses, until it was revealed that this very place was in fact located directly above a forgotten necropolis whose many layers had been built by several different peoples successively over the ages. Thus, the dreadful Onyx kingdom of Nabatem was built on top of all this lost history, and its culture around its fascination for the past, Baetyls and the Underworld."
#brief "Nabatem is a small and unhospitable kingdom of ruthless Onyx Amazon slavers whose capital is hidden in the red canyons of Saqaba's desert. Here, an entire temple-city is carved in stone to guard the entrances of innumerable caves that lead to an ancient necropolis and a river from the Underworld. The immortal lich-queens of Nabatem worship a dark god and its enigmatic baetylic messengers, black meteorites that radiate eerie energies and are being ritually erected as obelisks."
#summary "Race: Humans, prefer Heat scale +2, suffer less from Death scales.
Military: In all forts, cheap slaves, heavy infantry and frightful sacred cavalry. More sacred units in capital: anti-sacred heavy cavalry and immortal undead mages, generals and spirits.
Magic: High Death and Earth, some Astral and Water. Additional troops, mages and spells in wastes, caves and mountains.
Priests: Powerful. Pretender does not lose strength upon dying and can be recalled more easily. Dominion spreads Death."

#descr "In the ages past, the Pantokrator imprisoned many rivals and foes within the Earth along with the Dead, enclosing their souls in stone for all eternity thanks to a Seal so ancient that it predated even the birth of the world. And now, with the Pantokrator gone, there is a great and mysterious Awakening. The ancient Seal itself, that is to say, the geodetic World-Soul, is very slowly emerging from its aeon-long sleep, progressively revealing to mankind a consciousness of cosmic scale, and allowing the ancient spirits it absorbed so long ago to come back in the shape of sentient stones. Thus, a strange phenomenon that started near the Primeval Alignments of Karanaac in the forbidden highlands revered by the elder druids of Marverni is now expanding as an invisible, unexplainable force. Everywhere in the world, megaliths of venerable stature are spontaneously emerging without a hand to erect them, forming incredibly vast arrays of unknown origins and purpose. Reflecting in their precise ordering the framework of the Spheres, they seem to form a great microcosm-macrocosm concordance between the Earth and the Stars, a Harmonic Tapestry of Sacred Geometry - 'As Above, So Below'. Soon, under the unseen influence of those telluric resonances, even the simplest of pebbles shall retrieve their souls, join the Awakening and enter the Polyphony of Stones; and, irreversibly drawing to itself the fascination and worship of both men and animals by the eerie beauty of its unmovable song, a new God entirely estranged from Life shall ascend at the Centre of the World and transfigure all flesh by converting it to perfect stone."
#brief "In the silent fields of Karanaac, ancient stone alignments have waited patiently for millenia for the return of their master. Now, with the stars right and the Pantokrator gone, their vast consciousness is slowly awakening, and sentient megaliths are mysteriously rising everywhere in the world, ready to engulf mankind in the mystical vibrations of their gigantic communions."
#summary "Race: Sentient stones. Very durable, completely immobile, do not eat, heal, or cost upkeep or resources.
Military: Mass communion arrays of menhirs and singing stones that cannot move or attack. Doubled mercenary costs. Rely on teleportation spells to expand and attack.
Magic: High Astral, Nature and Earth, some Death. Innate spellcasters. Items hard to use. Exponential research and astral pearl production.
Priests: Powerful. Dominion kills 0.1 percent of population per candle and per month."

#descr "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Cyanautha is a martial thalassocracy which occupies a vast archipelago of small islands as well as a wondrous domain below the sea. In the ancient times, it was but a mundane city called Argolinth and a mere vassal to the great empire of the Telkhines, Therodos. But then, the Telkhines used blasphemous magic and angered the Pantokrator; that is when the soon-to-be God of Cyanautha first manifested. As a messenger of the Omnipotent One, he gave Argolinth a choice: either to accept his benediction and to join the war against its former masters, or to remain loyal and to be exposed to the same wrath. The people of Argolinth was and remains a strong and stubborn one and didn't cower in fear; but soon, out of mistrust and cruelty, the Telkhines brought down punishment upon the city anyway by forcing it to accomplish a series of impossible tasks. So all of the greatest Heroes of the city united, and together the Fifty spared no effort to achieve these feats; yet although they all were incredibly brave and skillful in many different areas, they wouldn't have succeeded without the hidden help of the God. So when the last of their tasks was complete, they returned to their lords and demanded retribution. The prideful Telkhines, of course, refused, and the Fifty rampaged across their palace, before pledging loyalty to the God along with their whole people - not out of weakness, but out of pure, indomitable thirst for revenge. And so they fought, until the Pantokrator spelled doom upon the Telkhines, casting their empire under the waves never to rise again; and if not for the blessing and protection of the God, the newly freed kingdom of Cyanautha would have perished alongside it. Since then, its people has lived peacefully but never stopped preparing for the war to come. And now, with the Pantokrator gone and both the Telkhine Spectre and the Fifty's Aegis awakening, the day for vengeance and glory is coming once again."
#brief "When the old empire of Therodos was ruined by divine decree, not all its inhabitants perished. Among its sunken vestiges and remaining islands, a wondrous city of soldiers and explorers was blessed with the gift of water breathing and swore to destroy the Telkhine Spectre forever. Now, Cyanautha's vast armies of pearl and gold clad hoplites are rising from the sea, and with the help of its colonies' mystics and engineers will soon reclaim the rightful heritage of its mythical heroes."
#summary "Race: Humans blessed with water breathing.
Military: Heavily armored and disciplined troops with magic weapons, some clad in awe-inspiring gold armor. Powerful war machinery. Forts increase resources by 25 percent.
Magic: Medium Water, weak access to all paths except Blood. Temples produce Water gems. Better research under Production scales.
Priests: Average, produce resources, recruitable without temples, researchers, unaffected by Drain or Magic scales. Sacred sailing heroes in every fort."

#name "Zun"
#epithet "Triumph of Femininity"
#era 1
#idealcold -3
#descr "Yet another city-state like those of Arcoscephale, Zun is the exotic queendom of the Garnet Amazons, a totalitarian matriarchy whose worship of Fire and Femininity results from its people's supernatural origins. Many centuries ago, when the enigmatic sorcerers of Abysia first started meddling with Blood magic, one of their goals was to create life and control it. Using both human flesh and everburning sulfur in their experiments, they slowly shaped new homunculi gifted with unnatural abilities and cursed with inhuman needs. Born from the Abysians' athanors, the Amazons of the Garnet Tribe are much unlike other living beings. Although they are blessed with an incredibly quick growth, an abnormally strong, tall and agile body and an inner fire that only dies out along with them, they also are vitally dependant on the usage of Blood magic, both for their reproduction and for their health. Thus, enslaved as living weapons by the Abysians, the Garnet Amazons were forced to wage war for their masters, until the wind of revolt started whispering to their ears. Realizing it before it was too late, their overlords punished them harshly, killing most of them like mere animals and selling the rest to greedy tyrants and blood mages of human descent. But this time, the Garnet Amazons were prepared, and they were not alone either. Side by side with what would become the other Amazon Tribes, they rebelled against their tyrants and slaughtered them. Together, they declared that man had no right to rule over woman, but then, the Amazons of the other tribes also elected to ban the Blood magic of their ancient enemies forever, and, horrified by the inhuman nature of their Garnet sisters, they also banished them from their nascent kingdom. Building the city of Zun in their exile, the Garnet Amazons soon prospered anyway in the hatred of both men and the other Amazon Tribes; and now, thirsty for Vengeance against their rivals, the Zunnites are preparing for war in the name of Justice."
#brief "Located in the burning sands of Zun is a temple-city home to the Garnet Amazons, magically altered humans that use Blood magic to clone their population. Their very martial society is led by the Vestals, mage-priestesses of Fire, Justice and Femininity. Its end goal is the supremacy of women over men, who are treated like livestock and forbidden the use of magic. Even the other Amazon Tribes are considered too lenient by the Zunnites, whose fanaticism rests on more than tradition: ideology."
#summary "Race: Artificially created and altered humans, nearly immune to fire, prefer Heat scale +3. Population can be magically increased.
Military: Cheap and disciplined Amazon infantry, sacred Gryphon Riders in every fort.
Magic: High Fire, Air and Blood, some Nature. Humanoid male mages other than the God are permanently muted, castrated and forced to hide their face.
Priests: Powerful, can blood sacrifice. Dominion decreases unrest by 1 per candle. Taxes increased by 3 percent per Order scale."

#name "U"
#epithet "Belly of the World"
#era 1
#idealcold -1
#descr "Although the world abounds with exotic marvels and mysteries, most explorers would agree that the mythical lands of U may be the strangest of them all, if not the most hospitable. Indeed, while barren, poor and uncivilized, they still retain a secret equally fascinating and unsettling, for they are populated by beings so bizarre that even when meeting them directly some have continued refusing to acknowledge their existence. These creatures of legend and madness, the blemmyes, are characterized by an extraordinarily grotesque anatomy, a primitive intelligence and a crude consonantless language. Seemingly straight up sprung from the silliest dreams - or maybe nightmares - of an absurd God, they look like disproportionate and hairless chimeras made of nothing but mistakenly assembled human bodyparts, most noticeably always missing a head, with their face - if any - being instead located in the middle of their torso. Apparently spawned directly from the earth by spontaneous generation, these sexless troglodytes actually believe that they originate from the remains of a dismembered deity like germs from a dead body, and that this properly Titanic entity, called Mu, is so ancient that it was killed by the first Pantokrator, and so gigantic that its belly would have become the whole world. Until now, blemmyes seemed to behave like mere cavemen, chaotic, wild, degenerate and ultimately harmless as long as their sterile territory was carefully avoided; but recently, this started to change. As the tribes of U gradually united under a mysterious call, increasingly weird and horrifying creatures have been sighted in its mountains, and it has been discovered that a new or resurfacing belief has emerged in the region, the concerning belief according to which the blemmyes' great Primogenitor shall soon be reborn in the form of a grand utopia, the imaginary Empire of Mu, which will finally let its children achieve their true nature and attain the glory they deserve."
#brief "In the rocky lands of U lives an uncivilized race of odd, troglodyte barbarians that are but a mockery of man - the headless blemmyes. The most common are the single-legged sciapods, but many even weirder kinds exist to defy reason and imagination. So primitive that both magic and technology are nearly unknown to them, they base their strength on numbers, athletism and stubbornness. But now, their God is awakening, and with him, forces so strange that they might engulf the world in absurdity."
#summary "Race: Blemmyes, primitive beings of various sizes missing a head and other bodyparts. Strong and numerous but soft and stupid. Halved income, Growth and Death.
Military: Mindless walking limbs called Protozoons, agile one-legged Sciapods, cannibalistic Epiphagoi, Gavagai giants, many even more grotesque monstrosities.
Magic: Extremely weak Earth and Blood. Incredibly stubborn Sophotatoi, who learn a single spell to the perfection and automatically cast it during battles.
Priests: Strong."

#descr "It is unknown why such a small and remote community as Bethel She'em was chosen by the Celestial Powers to become the focal point of such a great and sacred destiny. An inoffensive constellation of tiny towns and settlements populated mostly by simple shepherds and their families, this weak and unimportant country was across history protected from stronger nations only by its isolation in arid and unhospitable lands and by its lack of useful resources for foreign forces to take - and even then, at times it suffered greatly at the hands of various slavers and invaders, among which Hinnom, Abysia, C'tis and Ermor. Thus, it came up as an unbelievable surprise when for the first time a prophet appeared among this miserable people to announce the coming of Saviors from Heaven cloaked in flames and glory: in the desert he had found a miraculous thorny bush, everburning with holy fire and speaking with the Voice of a wrathful and benevolent God. Since then, Bethel She'em has waited for the promised arrival of the Lord's Angelic armies, hoping to at last know freedom and happiness. Centuries passed, each with its own lot of slavers, invaders and prophets, but eventually the prophecy came true and the mighty Denizens of the Sun - as a few call them - descended upon the Holy City; however, instead of bringing peace and prosperity as most interpreters thought they would, the Angels immediately began the execution of a terrible task: the Litany of Cinders, that is to say the complete and uncompromising eradication of mankind and all other living or intelligent beings, for now only sparing the most faithful among them. Thus intending to fully and absolutely purge the world of Sin, possibly in reaction to the Pantokrator's disappearance, they are about to put an end to History and, by Rapturing the pure of heart to Heaven where they'll supposedly know eternal bliss, they are preparing Creation as a whole for the completion of its true purpose and the Last Pantokrator's reign."
#brief "Isolated in an immaculate land of sand, rock, silence and solitude, the humble town of Bethel She'em was mysteriously chosen by a great deity as the place of her Awakening. As a result, celestial heralds of splendor known as Angels have descended upon it to prepare the world for her Glory and purge it from both sin and mankind. Now, from this Holy City in the desert, an Empire of light and cinder is expanding at an alarming rate, promising bliss to the faithful and eradication to everyone else."
#summary "Race: Angels; sacred, flying, awe-inspiring, nearly immune to mundane weapons.
Military: Summoned, some freespawn in Order scales.
Magic: Strong. Fire, Air, Astral.
Priests: Very strong. Non-angel priests are weakened before the glory of the God. Dominion kills 5 percent of the population per candle per month. The God can sacrifice himself for mighty effects and doesn't lose power when dying but will die again every other time when recalled, giving birth to a new star instead of returning."

#msg "Suddenly, a great echo resounded across the skies as the wind started howling and whispering above mountains and forests alike! It can only mean one thing: the Revolution of the Birds has begun once again. Everywhere in the world, wild bird tribes are leaving their peaceful lives and going to war against Mankind and the Gods. Innumerable of these winged warriors and chaotic troublemakers are now hiding in most provinces, and there is nowhere to escape them, except in lands devoid of life or underneath the earth or the sea. Their omnipresent, piercing gaze looks down upon terrestrial creatures, each day stealing away more information to the Flying City of Nephelococcygia. Acts of vandalism and impiety are being reported everywhere, and this anarchy won't stop until the birds have all been chased out of the lands of man and the horns of Revolution have been silenced!"

Bethel She'em's new prophet, Chosen One of the Concealed God, turned out to be the incarnate Flesh of a primordial Seal which kept material reality separate from the Infinite and protected it from complete dissolution! Now, every step of the Prophecy has been fulfilled, and with the final sacrifice of its Bearer, the Seal has been irreversibly broken and the Withdrawing of the Veil has begun. All omens now converge, all oracles now agree - the destruction of All no longer can be prevented, except for those fortunate enough to very soon find shelter in the holy presence of either pretender gods themselves or their temples. Already an eldritch manifestation of unprecedented scale can be witnessed at every corner of the angels' territory as incomprehensible entities from Beyond are starting to emerge above their temples, and there is no doubt that next month, when this process shall be concluded - everyone else will die."
