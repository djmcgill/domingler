#modname "jBrereton's Balance Mod, version 5.46k"
#description "The K stands for knowing that there ought to be some changes to the game."
#icon "./JBBM/jbbmv546k.tga"

-- v.5.46k

-- Deer now have an attack sprite
-- Dimvaettir are 2 commander rec points.
-- Father of the Sea given water breath and a bite attack.
-- Relatedly, water breath usable underwater.
-- MA Ermor's Wail now has a blood curdling scream noise instead of nothing.
-- It uses the relatively weak (cursing) LA Manx Wail as a primary weapon to enable this sound effect.
-- EA Ubar Houri and Shaytan have increased recruit point cost. Other changes may proceed in future.
-- Kannushi and Ancestor Guides have salt. Kannushi get a ritual baton instead of a Dagger, too.
-- Enchanted Salt is Constr 0 and 2 gems instead of 4 and 5.
-- Gana given salt vulnerability 1
-- Summon Ghulah is 46 slaves.

-- v.5.42j

-- Mind vessel removed. Androdai are now specialist leaders with multiple ranged attacks.
-- Asphodel given Growth 3 as a starting scale.
-- Short sword given Def 2, instead of 1. c.100 units directly affected. Wider balance implications frankly incalculable.
-- Strategos given a Bronze Sword rather than a short sword to ensure Arco did not benefit too heavily from this change.
-- Niefel line giants given low level fire vulnerability instead of 5 shock vulnerability across the board.
-- Nation descriptions on the giant factions to reflect why this is.
-- Son of Niefel -5 shock res and -15 fire res, but reduced in price to 200 points from 240.
-- Utgård gains the ability to recruit Hamaskarlar, slavers who can obtain human Ulfbanr, when Illwinter is up.
-- Bronze Colossi unobtainable as pretender gods. Now the Greek looking one is a construction 7 unique summon.
-- The Colossal Fetish able to heal again, and the Wooden Colossus With A Golden Fist 260 rather than 300 points.


-- v.5.9i3

-- AC no longer castable by mindless units.
-- The Monkey King gets a full retinue in every fight, including Horse, but as a centipede. He's 300 points now, 20 more expensive.
-- Ind sending out Bishop Generals should now only happen once.

-- v.5.9i2

-- Ind's, eh, Bitch-Mothers made 3 commander recruitment points
-- Ind made non-swamp start.
-- Ind and the Cynocephaleans get on well, now.
-- LA TC Prester King content tightened up. Better words, nicer sprite on the Emissary. The events work, even.
-- Shaytan are 101 blood slaves. It's a lot fewer than 1001, which would've been thematic, but it's also more than 73.
-- Betyls increased in cost by 40 points.
-- Camel Rider rework; 1 higher defence and 10 lower AP, 6 less map move, 4 less gold cost on the riders, 3 lower defence on the Falcons.
-- Jann Guard up to 36 rec point cost.
-- Khans given 1d3 Eagles

-- v.5.9i

-- Added underwater fort recruitment for Ind. Also swamp recruitment.
-- Nerfed Ind's capital unit costs.
-- Samog the Prester King hero added to LA TC.
-- The Bronze Colossi made 420 points, non healing and map move 8 instead of 22.
-- Also, TC gets one. They go mad for the bronze statues over there.
-- The old Colossal Fetish also made non-healing.
-- The Wooden Colossus with the golden fist is 300 points.

-- v5.9g2

-- Bakemono-sho turmoil discount removed, and human bandits have their turmoil discount reduced to 1 from 2.
-- The Equal of Heaven's compatriots made non-unique.
-- Phoenix Pyre made non-castable off script.
-- Lanka gets the Great Black Bull PG.
-- The Divine Emperor (Ermor, perer) made Innate (1). Also 160 points.
-- EA R'lyeh's Gibodai projections given a recpoint value. It doesn't matter to me,
-- at all, but it's for someone else's mod integration, and it's nice to be accommodating.

-- v5.9g

-- Giants broadly refuse to be led by commanders under size 4.
-- Fomorian giants with the exception of the Unmarked and Bres are Cursed, gaining double afflictions.
-- Fomorian Fir Bolg troops have lower morale.
-- Gath line giants have 2 less MR. They're too furious to be magically restrained.
-- Niefel line giants have 2 less defence due to being ponderous.

-- v5.9f4

-- Details added to some newly added spells, now that this is possible.
-- Magic Duel reverted to not being on an item since they made prec 100 stuff not miss (thanks IW)

-- v5.9f3

-- Hinnom's gaining affliction event split in half to ensure that both recruitable/PG type commanders
-- and heroes alike get the proper blood feasting affliction.
-- Living Castle may only target underwater provinces
-- Magic down from 3 point scaling to 2 point scaling - means Magic/Drain 2 will only provide 1 additional RP
-- Yomi's Mountain Sages have encumbrance 4, rather than ten, which was an accident.
-- The Statues of War (both eastern and western) summon shark tribe tritons underwater
-- Vafur Flames is a hidden enchantment.
-- Mothers of Avalon cost 215 gold rather than 175, which was a p unnecessary buff to man

-- v5.9f2

-- Bowl of Blood made to not target seas/deep seas
-- Archaic Fortress and Academy Underneath fort discovery events made unique to reduce spam.
-- All non-Kelp Fortress fort sites changed to be unique
-- (KF doesn't have the move-in events because most of the guys that benefit can't even build a fort UW)

-- v5.9f

-- Fort site events rationalised. After demolishing a fort, they will appear a turn afterwards.
-- Jomonese cav also gets 3 ambidexterity like Equites.
-- N�wa is added, as the Caretaker of the Sky, an AN monster pretender for the East Asia region.


-- v5.9e

-- Ermorian Equites of the Sacred Shroud given 3 ambidexterity to somewhat account for the reusable light lance.
-- LA Pythian Tribunii and Centurions given 5PR
-- Nature-remaining LA Pythium given Gift of the Sacred Swamp as a 0 research H1N1 priest spell
-- Xibalban guard swarms have a higher res cost to simulate paying for all their gear not about 3/8 of it.
-- Destruction doesn't cost a gem, it costs 60 fatigue instead.

-- v5.9d

-- By popular demand, mind you, there is a 50% chance the dog you find that's a stray dog is a Tlahuelpuchi.
-- Non-sacred Zotz changed to be big bat swarms with more strength the more numerous they are. Wall defenders
-- left as-is and non swarming bats may?? appear in events still, but recruitables are swarming. Their most
-- damaged form has recuperation to somewhat reduce affliction retention (but deliberately not eliminate it).
-- Revoked senseless Garmhirdling buff, back down to 12 att/11 def.
-- Vanarussian Chud Hirdman down to 28g/22rc, Chud Skinshifter at 28 rec, and Sages down to 155g (10g lower).

-- v5.9c

-- Hellenbrecht's horse flies again, because of course it can fly.
-- There is no reason that a vampire who loves horses wouldn't have a flying horse. Doesn't make a lick of sense.
-- Tenebrinavitas can also cast Katabasis.
-- Fall Bears, Summer Lions and Winter Wolves have element-neutral magic weapons.
-- Hinnom's Rephaites, Nephilim, and Melqarts gain afflictions if they can't eat people, but are cheaper.
-- Dance of the Morrigans is now a battle-side temporary summon similar to Corpse Candle, D4A2, 2 gems to cast, Conj level 7.
-- LA Mictlan given Rain Warriors as any-coast recruits. Doesn't show up on the Nation overview properly, does work, though.
-- Valkyrie in-battle summon reduced to 4 Valks for 1 gem.
-- Carrion Ladies and Lords can turn three, or five, nature gems into death gems per turn.
-- MA Caelum can turn 40 water gems into an Ice Castle at Constr 5; W4A2, 40 gems.

-- v5.9b

-- Gyan-Avspar have the #mounted tag like they always ought to've.

-- V5.9a

-- Gift of the Moon now 5 AoE/level
-- Asphodel always gets N4 on their first N3 Panic Apostate
-- Asphodel gets another 100 gold/turn for the first year to help with early income problems.
-- Fort sites give an event which creates their fort the turn after they are found, so any pre-existing worse
-- fort can be deleted if the province owner so wishes.
-- EA Caelan Raptors do actually have bronze equipment.
-- LA Lemuria and Ermor income back to 50%, fort unrest d20/turn rather than d30.
-- Duellist Trinkets now a 2h weapon to (largely) preclude insane bow tricks

-- V5.9

-- Laestrygonians on the LA Phlegran nation overview
-- Ulm's Sanguine Heritage is in there as a separate thing, Embrace Sanguine Heritage exists as a slightly earlier
-- and cheaper VC transform.
-- Sloth of Not That Sacred, And Worse, bears removed for Rus just to stop accidental casts + tidy up the list.
-- Duelling Trinkets are 5 gems rather than 10.
-- Finman boat is a targa now. Praying to all that is holy this stops the in-game download problems.
-- Mantis retain Magic Claws.

-- V5.8a

-- Magic Duel now on an Astral 2, Constr 4 item so it can have 200 precision, and back to being AoE 1.
-- Armor of Achillies and Destruction now always destroys armor for half prot, Magic or no.
-- Destruction, Legions of Steel, and Strength of Giants require 1 gem to cast.
-- Spectral Long Spear MRNH to negate like other spectral weapons.

-- V5.8

-- LA Pythium site recruitment more visible and readily understandable at the cost of making their nation overview a bit
-- of a shuttle crash.
-- No more Bracers. Well, cheers.
-- No more Rain, the spell. Enough's enough.
-- Holy Scourge and Herald Lance changed to have a holy fire secondary, same as the Dom Enhanced change. Flambeau left as-was.
-- LA Pan Grove Guard up to 38 rec from 18.
-- Lightless Lantern grants its user spirit sight.
-- Behemoth is Innate Caster (1) D1 if GoR'd. The elephant can think now. It's good.
-- Breaking the Seal does in fact break the seal. It's broken now.
-- Hidden in Snow summons can walk out of a mountain if it's cold.
-- Storm is slightly faster to make casting that relies on Summon Storm Power less unreliable.
-- Banishment's back baby. Versus demons.
-- Lanka and Yomi get H1 5 AoE/level and H3 whole battlefield Magic Resistance for Demon spells to help compensate.
-- All nations get a B4 4 slave spell to cast whole-battlefield Magic Resistance at Blood 6
-- Magic Duel Isn't AoE1 Anymore.
-- Namanari back to their vanilla state recpoint and research point-wise.
-- Western Dragons down to 230 points
-- From Death Comes Life 9 gem base cost rather than 3.
-- EA and LA Mictlan spread 2 dominion from their capitals. Mostly to prevent AI domscore death.
-- Hydrophoroi generate temporary gems only

-- V5.7a

-- Colossi Weavers rather than Light Inf cost 145
-- Kithaironic Lion Pelt up to 5E gem 5N gem cost instead of being extremely undercosted
-- Zhayedan with Dominion Immortality in Year 0 only, named Gyan-Avspar, back to prior type in years 1-onwards
-- Turan Zheyadan foot-troops in year 0 also, and Spahbed/Gyan-Avspar gryphons don't drop their gold trim after
-- the rider dies.
-- Aquatic/Amphian units slowed down slightly relative to JBBM v5.6 levels - still faster than in the base game
-- Growth changed to 1% income/.15% pop growth
-- Longdead and Ghouls made worse at pillaging

-- V5.7

-- Zhayedan made Dom Immortal rather than keeping the gryphons casually around
-- Lemuria and Ermor 35% income rather than 50
-- Wrath of the Ancestors 5+5/level rather than 20 immediately per cast, starting at 10
-- EA Pan forts cost gems instead of, incredibly, not costing gems
-- MA Marignon Witch Hunters back up to 185g
-- Baphomet costs 240 points from 140
-- Monolith costs 220 points from 160
-- Devourer of Souls costs 220 from 140
-- Marshmasters 3 Rec Points
-- Pan centaur units slightly lower rec point cost, 5 less than previous few versions on generics, WCs to 38 (29 base)
-- New item for Lanka to grant their living priests reanimation, D2, 5 gems, Constr 2.
-- Nazca Heroes Re-Added After I Accidentally Removed Them Like A Dunce.
-- Royal Mallqui up to 6 Rec Points
-- Pigsy made amphibian
-- Foul Vapors up to Ench 6
-- Additional clarity for EA Therodos, MA Ermor, Asphodel, and LA Lemuria in nation previews about their units.
-- MA Phlegra Shackled Mages back to 2 Comrec
-- Immobile twiceborn shapes for non lifeless immobile PGs
-- The Hat Which Makes You Cast Slower But Actually Just Works As A Fast Cast Hat due to the limitations of
-- the Fastcast command which treats negative and positive faster casting the same removed.
-- Instead, there's The Candle Lit At Both Ends, an item that grants 99 research per turn, at the expense of aging
-- its user 999 months per turn.
-- Coral Priests 2 recpoints, rather than 1.
-- Nazca Condors 5 per 10 gems rather than 3+ for 9
-- Nazca temple cost up to 650 pounds of gold.
-- Eriu Additions mod added to JBBM
-- Death/Growth up from 0% to 1% innate income bonus/decrease which is mostly irrelevant but helps convey usefulness

#descr "Sometimes the constant warring of the Demon Kings produces a particularly capable leader. Their reign of terror and arrogant treatment of their subordinates never lasts for more than a few decades, but they can dominate vast tracts of land until unseated. Oni are demons and don't need to eat. However, they have tremendous appetites and like to eat, and their human servants are often left starving if food is scarce. Oni are almost immortal. If their body is slain, their spirit will survive. If the spirit is not slain or banished as well, it will reform a new body over time. Oni are demons and can be banished. Their residual spirit form is a ghost and can be banished as well. "

The process of the parasitic merging somehow allows other minds to reside in the host besides the Androdai's own. Inside the distended skulls of the Androdai a whole host of Aboleths maintain their psychic presence, rendering uncountable legions of slaves susceptible to their domination. The unsuitability of their frame to this level of exertion means that Androdai, like Androleths, rarely live more than half a dozen years."

Within the first year of his birth, he had made himself king of a band of markata, learned all the magic of a great sage, and parlayed his immortality from the powers of the Underworld. The Pantokrator took notice of these bizarre happenings, and brought the Monkey King up to Heaven to keep an eye on him. After many failed attempts to educate the self-declared Equal of Heaven caused great damage to the celestial and material realms, the Pantokrator swore a curse upon him. For centuries, the Monkey King was trapped in place under a mountain, impatiently hectoring passers-by to free him from his fate, but after the disappearance of the Pantokrator, the hex has waned. Breaking free of his stony prison, he has decided to become the new Pantokrator, and reshape the world according to his own desires. He has encountered some old and new acquaintances along the way, and he and his motley crew have vowed not to stop until they reach their goal."

In his own right he was a mighty hero of the Pantokrator's armies, and was promoted upon his death to serve as a Marshall of the Heavenly Host. Once he arrived in Heaven, however, he became increasingly bored with the stilted surroundings of the afterlife and its politics. While on a thousand-year shift guarding the night sky, he fell in love with a particularly comely star. Instead of attending his duty, he spent his time composing ballads to her and drinking when she didn't reply. Disorderly comets fell upon the lands the Pantokrator ruled, and the people were no longer grateful for His protection. When this dereliction was noticed, the Marshall was thrown out of Heaven and cursed with great ugliness because of his lust. With the disappearance of the Pantokrator, he is no longer cursed with the form of an actual pig, and his licentiousness has subsided a little. The Equal of Heaven has promised him that in the course of the Great Sage's ascension to the Heavenly Throne, 'Pigsy' will one day regain his looks."

As he eagerly explains to those who come across the party, unlike the Equal of Heaven and Pig Aware of Ability, his downfall was simply due to an accident rather than a lack of virtue. As he was guarding the Pantokrator, he was caught up in an altercation with the Monkey King, in which a particularly important vase was broken. Instead of simply fixing the vase the instant it was shattered, in a fit of pique the Pantokrator used the time to expel the General. Nobody knows what was held within the vase that made it quite so valuable, and after the disappeance of the Pantokrator, perhaps no-one ever will. His encounter with the Equal of Heaven was quite by chance, as he accosted him crossing 'his' river before they reminisced about old times in his desolate cave. Noting the amusing irony of the General's fate, the Equal of Heaven has brought him along on his journey, although he has forbidden him from handling his many relics."

This heavenly being was until quite recently one of the many Princes of the Dragon King who lived beneath the waves, and delighted in helping his father to expand his realm atop a saddled dolphin. One day he was taken with divine madness and destroyed his father's most precious pearl while ten draconic guardsmen could not drag him away. As his enraged progenitor was about to strike his yari across the Prince's throat, the Pantokrator himself stopped the blow and commanded that the Prince be exiled rather than killed. A sudden wave then lifted him onto land in the form of a giant centipede repulsive to dragonkind, and washed him into the cave where the Equal of Heaven found him forlornly trying to dig a tunnel to his father's castle to apologise. The Great Sage knows that if the Prince's father wanted to find him again he could have done so very easily, and hopes that in the course of his Ascension to the Heavenly Throne his taciturn friend can learn to let go of the ties that bind him to his unhappy past."

With the coming of the new God, however, the Emerald Empire has regained its respect for the Theurgy of ages prior. The Basilica of the Spheres has been thoroughly renovated, and the prognostication of its Theurgs has regained its accuracy. Although still confined largely to the capital, the order predicts it will one day regain its lofty position and become the sole keeper of the faith once more. The Theurg Primae are the highest of their order, and although their magic may have less raw power than the Arch Theurgs of the past, it is wider in breadth. Some Primae utilise the magic of the Serpent Cult in their own rituals."

Over time, however, their abilties faded, and a more modern cult around the Sacred Swamps took precedence, alongside many mystery cults. With the coming of the new God, however, the Emerald Empire has regained its respect for the Theurgy of ages prior. The Basilica of the Spheres has been thoroughly renovated, and the prognostication of its Theurgs has regained its accuracy. Although still confined largely to the capital, the order predicts it will one day regain its lofty position and become the sole keeper of the faith once more."

#descr "With the expansion of the Theurgy come many applicants to the Order. Not all are sufficiently talented to become full Theurgs, but they may still provide some use to the mages of the Spheres. Theurg Communicants are acolytes trained in the Theurgical arts. They lack the arcane skills of true Theurgs, but are able to strengthen the magic of senior Theurgs by acting as communion slaves. The Communicants automatically cast the Communion Slave spell before combat."

#descr "The rebuilding of the Basilica of the Spheres has come alongside a renewed spirit of moral propriety within the Pythian nobility. The old practice of giving away illegitimate daughters to the priesthood has returned, and the armies of the Emerald Empire once again have Vestals fighting by their side. These holy warriors are trained along similar lines to the Palatina and are fearsome warriors and bodyguards. In accordance with current military principles, they wear armour and fight at a longer reach than the Vestals of years prior, much as the Comitatense no longer close and stab their foes."

To encourage competition among their order, the Renati ensure that not everyone who takes their initiation rites becomes a priest. Typically these men have been judged lacking in the temperament and charisma to prosthelytise, but display adequate competence at necromancy. Although not wholly initiated in the rites of the priestly leadership, those skilled in Death magic are given privileges above those talented in the other magical arts, as many scholars in the Empire believe that the Augurs' jealous deceit was the cause of Ermor's collapse. Whatever the reason for their loyalty, the shade beasts of the Biarchi Canis are a great help to the rulers of the Emerald Empire in its wars of conquest."

The Eleutherii are opposed to the Revellers that inhabit the minor cities of the Emerald Empire as much as they are to the Serpent Cult that once ruled Pythium. The Cult is restricted to officer-ranking veterans as members in its theological leadership, and works to benefit the interests of the military at every turn. It emphasises the sacrifices that all citizens must make for the Empire in its times of need, and is very active in soliciting donations to provide for ex-servicemen. Although they do not engage in the ritualised blood sacrifices of many other nations, the celebrations of the Cult of the Bloodied Liberator are often held in the arenas of Pythium's cities and take the form of ritualised battles in which the current or historical soldiers of the Empire vanquish their foes. The priests themselves are skilled healers and ensure they stay in good physical shape, but they are too often distracted by theatrical duties to command large numbers of soldiers."

They do not possess any particular command authority, and have a reputation for quickly running to fat once off the battlefield, but many retain the trappings of their former lives as legionnaires."

Their experience and guidance is appreciated by other soldiers, and they have usually picked up a few of the most successful ways to inspire their comrades, whether bawdy jokes, anecdotes from their time in the far corners of the known world, or calculated silence. In return for their loyalty, their families are given substantial bonuses from the treasury of the Church, and their first son may inherit his father's salary grade when they enlist. Although there have been ranklings from some of the Magistri Militarum about the potential this has to disrupt the treasury and cause resentment among the Limitanae, the coming of the new God and present conflict has impressed the need for drastic action upon the Emerald Empire. The Sanguiplumbatatore are named for their blessed darts, intended to inflict bleeding wounds upon their opponents. They are very dangerous to man and beast alike, although larger targets may resist the effect."

The stated purpose of this edict is to ensure they are given proper military training, but it also ensures that the rulers of Mekone have great leverage over their internal rivals. In the War Against the Gods, these students are tremendously brave and eager to prove themselves, although curiously not one has obtained their Hoplon yet."

Given arcane collars forged by the Elder Cyclopes, these Shackled Mages are joined in a forced communion dominated by the Oppressors. The Shackled ones are usually forced to do research for their masters, where their limited abilties are always pushed to the absolute limit.

Helote warriors have abysmal morale and need to be whipped into coercion by their Tyrants or human taskmasters in order to fight effectively.

After the corruption of the Purifying Flame the Daevas were banished from this world and the Mairyas found themselves without leadership. Many of the old ways were lost and the Raptor Clan all but disappeared. With the rise of the Harab Seraphim, the Fravashi no longer protect the righteous. Instead the ever-whispering ghosts of the Mairya try to lead the flock astray."

#descr "The Grey Ones, Graeae, are three crone sisters spawned by Phorkys, Father of Monsters, at the dawn of time. When the Pantokrator reformed the world he slew or banished all monsters that threatened the world. The Graeae, while not nearly as powerful as their father, were imprisoned and chained in a stygian cavern as a precaution. For millennia the crones have waited, getting older and angrier for every year that passed. Now with the Pantokrator gone, their shackles are weakening and their malice can be felt by those who dream. The Grey Ones are incredibly old and their bodies are frail and weak. Two of the sisters have lost their eyesight and now the three of them share a single eye. All three sisters use death and water magic, but they have all mastered different magical paths. The first of the Sisters, 'the Terrible', uses blood and nature magic. The second sister, known as 'the Warlike' uses fire and earth magic and the third sister, 'the Destroyer' uses air and astral magic. Their connection to the realms of undeath is so strong that were they to protect themselves from death, they would come back in their own form."

#descr "These curious vegetables were first concieved of by a particularly entrepreneurial hoburg greengrocer of a distant age. During a previous Ascension War he found that selling normal or even relatively large vegetables would only bring him comfortable prosperity and not the great wealth he had been led to expect. Pondering on the best path to riches, he seized on the idea of carrots helping people to see in the dark, all the better to spot necromancers and their shades with. Alongside an enterprising committee of horticulturalists, he created a guard carrot which would raise the alarm and try to hold intruders in place until either local town guards or a wandering band of heroes arrived to dispense justice. These Watchers were an unexpectedly overwhelming success, far beyond their creators' original hopes, and have provided sustenance and security to the world ever since. They are relatively easy to care for and have often been sown in the most important sites of former ages by forgotten stewards of the land. Their hoary skin provides some protection from weapons, although a well-armed and determined attacker may well defeat them in a violent tussle."

While most of Eriu's people live in thrumming villages full of activity and sound, or palisades replete with elegant carvings, the islanders mainly live in wind-battered hamlets, carved into the sides of hills and dominated by austere stone towers. One of the pecularities of the island-dwelling Milesians is their funerary rites. On many islands there is no space for graves, so instead local holymen perform sky burials with the help of local sea eagles. While necessary, they are at best kept at a distance to most of society if not openly reviled. Between funerals, they ponder the mysteries of the sea and sky in solitude. For now, the returning Tuatha tolerate the practice for humans, but the priests only have local authority."

#name "Sea-Troll Sage"
#descr "Some decades ago an arrogant young chief whose name is lost to history attacked a migrating clan of Sea Trolls for their bones, skin, and fat, as arrogant young chiefs whose names are lost to history periodically do. After the axes stopped falling and fists stopped swinging, the Trolls and many of the warriors were dead, and the local priest, Murchad, was ordered to render the Trolls and prepare the fallen for the birds. As he began his grim task, however, Murchad heard the wailing of an infant Trollet. Being a kindred eccentric outcast, Murchad decided on the spur of the moment to try his hand at raising the young Troll.

After years of increasingly spurious reasons for his ever-expanding home, strangely vigorous night-fishing, and deep eminations of spellcasting, the priest brought young Briain to the market square in a laughably weak disguise. Rather than being terrified or offended, most of the by now rather old villagers were touched by the attempted humanity of Murchad and absolutely delighted by the abysmal poetry Briain proudly recited about his love of their island home. As the local people grew to trust him, he learned to help their fishermen by creeling without a boat, simply flicking his pot out at anything he wanted to catch, a skill he has developed to deadly effect to defend his new-found friends. Hearing of widespread attacks by Merrows, he has ventured to the capital in an attempt to disprove some assumptions about sea-dwellers and secure a future for all the Milesians of the coasts."

#selectmonster 2031 -- Melqart, Hinnom Edition
#gcost 385 -- Reduced by 100g due to blood feast
#popkill 5 -- Reduced to take into account blood feasting
#descr "There are several races of giants in the land of Hinnom. The Rephaim are the sons of the Nephilim and the rulers of the land. They are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught all kinds of secrets by their fathers and are born with magical powers. A Melqart is a king and ruler of a city and a descendant of Azazel. Azazel revealed the secrets of war, weapons and cosmetics to the Avvim, and his legacy runs strong in the blood of the Melqarts. The Melqarts have gruesome appetites and many of them feast on the flesh of their smaller kin. Some cities have actually been destroyed in horrible blood feasts at the whim of a Melqart. With the Nephilim-worship, the Melqarts became sons of gods and they have deluded themselves that they are strengthened by the sacrifice of blood. They have started to demand blood sacrifices to keep their hideous banquets overflowing with fresh flesh, and their ill-founded belief is so strong that if there are no victims around they will even resort to consuming parts of themselves to maintain their essence."

#selectmonster 2032 -- Baal, Hinnom Edition
#gcost 355 -- Reduced by 100g due to blood feast
#popkill 2 -- Reduced to take into account blood feasting
#descr "The Ba'als are Rephaite Lords and favored by the Nephilim. Living lives of luxury and splendor, they lead their kin in the absence of the Nephilim. Having godlike puissance and absolute power over their subjects has made them arrogant and depraved. Surrounded by loyal Rephaim and Avvite slaves, they were quite unaware of the growing resentment of the Avvim and several Ba'als and Melqarts were killed in uprisings. To preserve order, they created a cult of Nephilim-worship and created the order of the Kohanim. After the cult was established, the Melqarts became deluded, called themselves gods and drank the blood of the Avvim to gain their strength. The Ba'als followed suit and have turned into bloodthirsty God-kings who would threaten the world all the more did they not believe that they needed fresh flesh to maintain their vigor. The Ba'als are born with the power of their father, but they rarely learn other magical paths."

#descr "The Melqart is a Rephaite king of a city. Once the Rephaim all lived in Hinnom, but when the Berytians founded colonies near the city of Ashdod, they were influenced by Rephaites and began to worship the Rephaite kings as gods. Now most Berytian colonies have a great temple to a Melqart god, praying for its eventual arrival. The Melqarts are huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers. They have been taught all kinds of secrets by their fathers and are born with magical powers. They are descendants of Azazel and share his gifts. The Melqarts have gruesome appetites and feast on the flesh of men. If none are around, they will go so far as to feast on themselves, such is their belief that this is the only way to maintain their power."

Once the Rephaim all lived in Hinnom, but when the Berytians founded colonies near the city of Ashdod, they were influenced by the Rephaites and began to worship them as gods. The Melqart is huge of stature and deathly pale. Horns grow from his forehead and his hands have six fingers. The Melqart is a descendant of Azazel and shares his gifts, appetites, and alongside all other Rephaites the powerful misapprehension that if he is denied living flesh his will wither. With the Pantokrator gone, he is free to claim the world as his banquet."

When the stars fell to earth, she blocked their path as best she could. When fire scorched the crops, her dewy tears extinguished the flames. But the Pantokrator grew tired of her do-gooding when she thwarted their divine wrath, and sent her as far away as they could imagine. She has anxiously returned across the planes, only to arrive at a world desolated by her absence. With old and new types of calamity erupting everywhere, the Caretaker of the Sky has decided that she could do a much better job of protecting the world and heavens without any other Pretender Gods causing havoc, and now wishes to Ascend and safeguard the cosmos according to her own plan."

#selectmonster 1662 -- Disease Demon
#spr1 "./JBBM/disdem1.tga"
#spr2 "./JBBM/disdem2.tga"
#descr "The disease demon is a bringer of disease and illness. It feeds on the prayers and promises given by the despairing victims of its fevers. Its mere presence causes healthy men to cough and shiver. The disease demon disguises itself as a scuttling orderly in the plague-houses of the world. Evil demonologists summon these demons and send them to haunt their enemies. Those that keep their distance may survive such an attack, but others will not be so fortunate."

-- STATUES OF WAR DESCRIPTION

#selectmonster 2463 -- Statue of War, Western
#descr "The Statue of War is a primordial spirit of strife and turmoil once bound in a huge stone statue by a previous Pantokrator to save the world from its destructive influences. With the Pantokrator gone, its powers are unleashed and strife and war have once more come to the world. Barbarian warriors gather in the land of the statue to wreak havoc and plunder. More barbarians arrive if the turmoil of the province is high. In the seas, ravening Shark Tribe Tritons congregate instead. The spirit cannot leave the statue, but it can possess willing targets in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items for enchantment. The spirit is tremendously strong in its Dominion. In a physical battle, the statue would be difficult to destroy, even though it cannot strike back."

When the Vaetti Jarldom formed the last Jotun warriors were given tasks the Vaettir couldn't fill. One such task was boulder hurling. The Vaettir use bows and crossbows, but the sheer strength of the Jotun giants allows them to use unconventional weapons. The hurlers carry large boulders, which they hurl onto heavily armed opponents or castle walls. The giants of Vaettiheim are far less haughty than those of Utgård, and will accept subordination to smaller leaders. Jotuns are descendents of primordial giants hunted by a God of Thunder. Thunder and lightning still recognise their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning."

The Rephaim have gruesome appetites and many of them feast on the flesh of their smaller kin, who they hold in contempt. They will devour food, beasts, men and kin and as long as there is population in a province, they do not starve, although the populace will suffer. They are much feared by the Avvim and Horim and are considered sacred."

With the encouragement of the Khans, a charismatic chieftain of the dog-headed peoples by the name of Samog has been eased into his mantle as the new Prester King and will cajole the world to fall under the sway of the Empire. As well as being a blood mage of some talent, he can destroy the Ancestors of those who anger him without so much as a thought, and possesses a sword that cuts through steel as if it were mud.

The Prester King openly acknowledges the fall of the Onyx Court, and candidly reproaches its earlier hypocrisy. In His Royalest Highness' own words, even the Cannibal Tribes shone with virtue compared to the venality of the late Bishop-Vicomtes.

The Prester King has retaken control of the domain his forebears misruled and corrected its doctrine. Alongside the Child of Heaven his long grasp personally ensures the security and prosperity of those who submit to his authority, and conversely the harrowing misery of those who reject it - with a power that reaches beyond death."

Such rumours are spread by the more streetwise archmages of the world in an attempt to entice arrogant initiates to do their busywork. The Candle Burnt at Both Ends causes its user to be capable of uncovering incredible amounts of magical knowledge at the price of their life's blood. The sensation is potently addictive, and mages under its influence will desperately work themselves to death night and day to pursue more secrets for one who threatens to take it away."

At the centre of this unforgiving land lies a great cone-shaped mountain at the top of which is a gate to the Netherworld. From this gate Oni have come, one by one or in small groups. Oni are demons of the wild, ugly, pot-bellied, and mischevious. They are ruled by Oni Kings who occasionally emerge from the Netherworld to wreak havoc on the land of the living. The humans of this land pay tribute at the temples of the Demon Kings, and summon Oni on behalf of their masters. Oni are almost immortal and must be killed in spirit and body to be killed."

Military: Semi-Immortal Oni, Bakemono and human servants. Light and medium infantry.

#selectnation 22 -- Niefelheim
#descr "Niefelheim, the Land of Eternal Frost, was once the home of the frost giants. The Rimtursar, primordial giants of godlike powers, were the undisputed rulers of the world until a God of Thunder hunted and slew them. From the cold glaciers in Niefelheim, frost giants have emerged anew. These Niefel Giants are not nearly as powerful as their ancestors, but they are stronger by far than the giants of later ages. Giants are immensely strong and resilient, and the Jotuns are even stronger and tougher than other giant races. They are almost impervious to the cold of winter, but thunder and lightning still recognizes their old quarry and the giants of the land greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts. To protect themselves the Jotuns cake their bodies in seal guts, goose fat, and anything else they can get their hands on to disperse lightning. As a side effect, this makes them a little vulnerable to bursting into flames when fighting outside of their snomy home. Niefelheim is ruled by several Jarls who rarely join forces. Gygjas, old and wicked hags, serve the Niefel giants with sorcerous advice. The people of Niefelheim prefer to live in very cold provinces, and the icy winds of their home sweep over nearby lands."
#end

#selectnation 61 -- Jotunheim
#descr "Jotunheim is a land of bitter winters and cool summers. It is the home of the Jotuns, a race of giants descendant from the Rimtursar, frost giants of goldlike powers sprung from glacial ice at the dawn of time. These primordial giants were hunted and slain by a God of Thunder. Giants are immensely strong and resilient, and the Jotuns are even stronger and tougher than other giant races. They are almost impervious to the cold of winter, but thunder and lightning still recognizes their old quarry and the Jotuns greatly fear the wielders of lightning bolts. To protect themselves the giants of the land cake their bodies in seal guts, goose fat, and anything else they can get their hands on to disperse lightning. As a side effect, this makes them vulnerable to bursting into flames when fighting outside of their frigid home. Jotunheim has no king and is ruled by several Jarls who rarely join forces. In the heart of Jotunheim lies an ancient Forest of Iron and Ice. Here live the Jarnvidjur, Gygjas from an earlier era, endowed with unequaled sorcerous powers. They are served by the Vaettir, who are small, wicked goblins of the woodlands. The Vaettir rarely venture outside of their arboreal climes, but do join the armies of Jotunheim and the Gygjas bid them. The people of Jotunheim prefer to live in very cold provinces."
#end

#selectnation 96 -- Utgård aka Utgard
#descr "Utgård is a land of bitter winters and cool summers. It was once Jotunheim, the home of the giants. But with the coming of man, the giant population has dwindled. After man ventured to the icy lands of Jotunheim, the giants of Jotun discovered the humans to be resourceful allies. With the coming of the Awakening God, old grudges have been cast aside and men and giants fight side by side. The alliance with the humans has estranged the Gygjas and their Vaetti servants, who no longer aid the giants. Instead, human seeresses have become influential. In the heart of Utgård lies the magical Well of Urd, where the Norns gather and divine the future of the world. The giants of Utgård are immensely strong and resilient. They are born in the cold and do not suffer from cold climates. The people of Utgård prefer to live in cool provinces."

#msg "A far-flung leader of the Cynocephalians has presented to the court of your highness.

He offers his services as the new Prester King, master of the descendants of Gog and Magog, while offering obeisance to the throne of the Child of Heaven. Samog also claims to have been trained to fight skeletons by a dying Spirit Guide, which he duly and rather impressively demonstrates with the help of a courtier.

After a trip to the Imperial Armory, this new ruler has been furnished with fetching garb and a tremendous blade, and an aide-memoire has been sent from the Imperial Oubliette about an intriguing strategy involving some very old residents.

Letters are being composed, and soon the peoples of the world will quake in fear at this direst of vassals. With such mighty servants, none may doubt that ##fullgodname## will ascend triumphant!"

#msg "A delegation of dog-headed beastmen and a curiously armed Atlantean have appeared under the standard of T'ien Ch'i. An assistant reads their message:

TREMBLE, O YE FAITHLESS!

These words come at the behest of His Highestness, the Prester King. I rule over trackless lands. I plumb the darkest caves. My majesty is unbound by the clouds above.

I serve a very righteous God, who I hold to be the Child of Heaven. They have drunk of the Fountain of Youth, and their end will assuredly come after yours - as will mine.

This warrior and his armaments are a gift to you. I know that none like him exist in your land. He is just one of my host, and countless skilled warriors dissimilar to yours call me their leader.

Submit and become our tributary. We offer peace. We offer reprieve from the horde that buries our foes. We offer you safety from THE MAGOG that even I struggle to restrain.

Think on this, and reply quickly!"
